Unit one Text A Muscle-1

????Most cells possess cytoskeletal elements that are capable of lengthening or shortening and so enable the cell to change its shape. This capacity is important in a variety of cellular functions， e.g., locomotion，phagocytosis, mitosis and extension of processes. Proteins referred to as molecular motors can effect changes of length much more rapidly than systems that are dependent on polymerization-depolymerization mechanisms (actin,tubulin),by using energy from the hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate(ATP). Of these ATP-dependent systems, one of the most widespread is based on the interaction of actin and myosin. 
??In muscle cells the filaments of actin and myosin and their associated proteins are so abundant that they almost fill the interior of the cell. Moreover they align predominantly in one direction，so that interactions at the molecular level are translated into linear contraction of the whole cell. The ability of these specialized cells to change shape has thus become their most important property. Assemblies of contractile muscle cells，the muscles, are machines for converting chemical energy into mechanical work. The forces generated move limbs，inflate the lungs, pump blood, close and open tubes,etc. In man,muscle tissue constitutes 40-50% of the body mass.
Muscle cells (fibers are also known as myocytes (the prefixes myo- and sarco- are frequently used in naming structures associated with muscle). They differentiate along one of three main pathwaysto form skeletal, cardiac or smooth muscle. Both skeletal and cardiac muscle may be called striated muscle, because their myosin and actin filaments are organized into regular, repeating elements which give the cells a finely cross-striated appearance when they are viewed microscopically. Smooth muscle, in contrast, lacks such repeating elements and thus has no striations.

????Other contractile cells, including myofibroblasts and myoepithelial cells, are different in character and developmental origin. They contain smooth muscle-like contractile proteins and are found singly or in small groups. 
????Skeletal muscle forms the bulk of muscular tissue of the body and consists of parallel bundles of long, multinucleate fibers. This type of muscle is capable of powerful contractions (about 100 watts per kilogram) because of the regular organization of its contractile proteins. However, the price paid for this organization is a limited contractile range: wherever a larger range of movement is required, it is achieved through the amplification provided by the lever systems of the skeleton to which the muscle is attached (hence the name skeletal muscle)(see below).

????Skeletal muscle is (innervated by somatic motor nerves. It is sometimes referred to as voluntary muscle, because the movements in which it participates are often initiated under conscious control. However, this is a misleading term: skeletal muscle is involved in many movements, such as breathing, blinking, swallowing, and the actions of the muscles of the perineum and in the middle ear, which are usually or exclusively driven at an unconscious level. 
????Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, and in the walls of large veins where they enter the heart. It consists of a branching network of individual cells that are linked electrically and mechanically to function as a unit. Compared with skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is much less powerful (3–5 watts per kilogram) but far more resistant to fatigue. It is provided with a continuous supply of energy by numerous blood vessels around the fibers, and abundant mitochondria within them. Cardiac muscle differs structurally and functionally from skeletal muscle in some important respects. It is, for example, intrinsically capable of rhythmic contraction, with a rate and strength which is nevertheless responsive to hormonal and autonomic nervous control.

????Smooth muscle is found in all systems of the body, in the walls of the viscera , including most of the gastrointestinal , respiratory , urinary and reproductive tracts, in the tunica media of blood vessels, in the dermis (as the arrector pili muscles), in the intrinsic muscles of the eye, and the dartos muscular layer of the scrotum. In some places, smooth muscle fasciculi are associated with those of skeletal muscle, e.g. the sphincters of the anus and the urinary bladder , the tarsal muscles of the upper and lower eyelids, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum , a transitional zone in the esophagus , and fasciae and ligaments on the pelvic aspect of the pelvic diaphragm.

????Smooth muscle contains actin and myosin, but they are not organized into repeating units, and its microscopic appearance is therefore unstriated (smooth). The elongated cells are smaller than those of striated muscle, and taper at the ends. They are capable of slow but sustained contractions, and although this type of muscle is less powerful than striated muscle, the amount of shortening can be much greater. These functional attributes are well illustrated by its role in the walls of tubes and sacs , where its action regulates the size of the enclosed lumen and, in some cases, the consequent movement of luminalcontents. 
????A smooth muscle cell may be excited in several ways, most commonly by an autonomic nerve fiber, a blood-borne neurohormone , or conduction from a neighboring smooth muscle cell. Since none of these routes is under conscious control, smooth muscle is sometimes referred to as involuntary muscle.

Unit one Text B Anatomy of Breathing-1

????Breathing is a highly coordinated abdominal and thoracic process. The diaphragm is the major muscle of inspiration , responsible for approximately two-thirds of quiet breathing in healthy humans. The external intercostal muscles are most active in inspiration, and the internal intercostals, which are notas strong, are most active in expiration. Increasing the vertical, transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the chest increases the volume of the pleural space, and the resulting decrease in intrapleural pressure draws air into the lungs. During expiration, the diaphragm relaxes and moves superiorly. Air is expelled from the lungs and the elastic recoil of the lung creates a subatmospheric pressure that returns the lateral and anteroposterior dimensions of the thorax to normal (De Troyer & Estenne 1988, Celli 1998).

????During inspiration, the lowest ribs are fixed, and contraction of the diaphragm draws the central tendon downwards. In this movement, the curvature of the diaphragm is scarcely altered. The cupolae move downwards and a little forwards almost parallel to their original positions. The associated downward displacement of the abdominal viscera is permitted by the extensibility of the abdominal wall, but the limit of this extensibility is soon reached. The central tendon, its motion arrested by the abdominal viscera, then becomes a fixed point from which the fibers of the diaphragm continue to contract. This causes the second to tenth ribs to be elevated and the inferior portions of the ribs are turned outwards as a result of direct transmission of pressure through the zone of apposition (Fig. 1). The medial aspect of the rib is elevated and this increases the transverse dimension of the chest in the same manner as a bucket handle swinging outwards (Fig. 2A). This effect is most evident in the lower ribs (seventh to tenth ribs). Movements at the costovertebral joints cause elevation of the anterior ends of the ribs that push the body of the sternum and the upper ribs forwards. This 'pump handle' movement is most evident in the superior ribs (second to sixth ribs) and increases the anteroposterior dimension of the thorax (Fig. 2B). The right cupola of the diaphragm, which lies on the liver , has a greater resistance to overcome than the left, which lies over the stomach, and so the right crus and the fibers of the right side are more substantial than those of the left. The balance between descent of the diaphragm, protrusion of the abdominal wall ('abdominal' breathing), and elevation of the ribs ('thoracic' breathing) varies in different individuals and with the depth of ventilation . The thoracic element is usually more marked in females, but increases in both sexes during deep inspiration.
Fig.1Inspiratory movements: pressure changes during inspiration. (Adapted from Drake, Vogl and Mitchell 2005.) 
Fig.2Movements of the ribs during inspiration (A) increase the transverse diameter of the chest by the 'bucket handle' movement, and (B) increase the anteroposterior dimension of the thorax by the 'pump handle' movement.
?Diaphragmatic excursion is typically 1.5 cm in quiet breathing. During deep ventilation, the maximum movement ranges from 6 to 10 cm. After a forced inspiration, e.g. when breathing is partially obstructed, the right cupola of the diaphragm can descend to about the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra, while the left cupola may reach the level of the body of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. After a forced expiration, the right cupola of the diaphragm is level anteriorly with the fourth costal cartilage, laterally with the fifth, sixth and seventh ribs, and posteriorly with the eighth rib, and the left cupola is a little lower.
The level of the diaphragm is affected by the phase and depth of ventilation, and by the degree of distension of the stomach and intestines and the size of the liver. Radiographs show that the height of the diaphragm within the thorax also varies considerably with posture. It is highest when the body is supine , and in this position it performs the greatest ventilatory excursions with normal breathing. When the body is erect, the diaphragm is lower, and its ventilatory movements become smaller. The diaphragmatic profile is still lower in the sitting posture, and ventilatory excursions are smallest under these conditions. When the body is horizontal and on one side, the two halves of the diaphragm do not behave in the same way. The uppermost half sinks to a lower level than that seen when sitting, and moves little with ventilation. The lower half rises higher in the thorax than it does even in the supine position, and its ventilatory excursions are considerably greater. Changes in the level of the diaphragm with alterations in posture explain why patients with severe dyspnea are most comfortable, and least short of breath, when sitting up. 
The primary role of the intercostal muscles is to stiffen the chest wall, preventing paradoxical motion during descent of the diaphragm in inspiration. This becomes most obvious immediately after high spinal injury, when there is flaccid paralysis of the entire trunk and only the diaphragm is left functioning. In a healthy adult with a vital capacity of 4.5 L , some 3 L is accounted for by diaphragmatic excursion. Immediately after high spinal injury, the vital capacity decreases to about 300 mL, even though the diaphragm is moving maximally, because some 2.7 L is lost by paradoxical incursion of the flaccid chest wall as the diaphragm descends. With time (usually several weeks), the paralysis becomes spastic, stiffening the chest wall, and the vital capacity increases towards its phrenic limit of about 3 L.
?In the same way, high spinal injury reveals the role of the abdomen in inspiration and expiration. The abdominal musculature plays a major role in active expiration in man. During the flaccid stage of high spinal paralysis, the only mechanisms available for returning the relaxed diaphragm into the thorax on expiration are passive recoil of the lungs and chest wall, and the weight of the abdominal viscera. The latter is the most important, and operates only when patients are lying down. If they are sat up or raised upright, they are unable to breathe out. Trussing the abdomen with an elastic binder can help such patients. Conversely, when paralysis becomes spastic, the stiff abdominal wall opposes inspiration.

????The role of the abdomen in breathing is often underestimated. If, for example, the anterolateral wall were made of steel and linked the pelvic rim rigidly to the costal margins , inspiration would be impossible. The diaphragm could not descend (because the abdominal contents are incompressible), and the ribs could not rise (because the links to the pelvis would be inextensible). During normal breathing, the abdomen relaxes as the diaphragm contracts. It is possible to oppose this motion by tensing the abdomen, as in the ' beach posture ' adopted to exaggerate the size of the chest. In this case, the abdominal contents fix the central tendon of the diaphragm, so that it raises the ribcage as it contracts, but it is a condition of that maneuver that the gap between the ribs and the pelvic rim widens.
?The ventilatory muscles must also work during sleep, when the pharyngeal muscles relax and upper airway resistance increases. It is now appreciated that in some people, particularly the obese, this relaxation can lead to periodic apnea and marked hypoxia during sleep, implying that the pharyngeal muscles play an important ventilatory role in waking life. It is also clear that although ventilatory muscles rarely tire in normal life, they do fatigue when placed under abnormal loads, e.g. in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
????The different pulmonary regions do not all move equally in ventilation. In quiet ventilation, the juxtahilar part of the lung scarcely moves and the middle region moves only slightly. The superficial parts of the lung expand the most, and the mediastinal surface, posterior border and apex move less, because they are related to less movable structures. The diaphragmatic and costomediastinal regions expand most of all. Most of the volumetric change during ventilation occurs in the alveoli.


Unit two Text A Integumentary System-1

????The (integument , the largest organ of the body, is composed of skin and skin appendages —nails, hair, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands . The total weight and overall surface area of skin in the adult are 3–5 kg and 1.5–2 m2, respectively. Skin thickness, between 0.5 and 3 mm, varies regionally; skin is thickest on the back and thinnest on the eyelid. As well as serving as a protective barrier against injury (e.g., abrasions , cuts, burns), infectious pathogen , and ultraviolet radiation , skin assists in body temperature regulation, vitamin D synthesis, ion excretion , and sensory reception (touch and pain), and it has a remarkable regenerative capacity. It consists of the epidermis and the dermis . A loose layer of subcutaneous cutaneous tissue, the hypodermis , attaches skin to underlying structures and permits movement over most body parts(Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 ??Schematic of skin and its appendages that shows the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis consists primarily of cells called (keratinocytes , which make up more than 90% of the cell population . Other epidermal cells are melanocytes , Merkel cells , and Langerhans cells . Four or five distinct layers constitute the epidermis. The stratum , or germinativum , is the deepest; it consists of a single layer of closely packed basophilic cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells, resting on a basement membrane . These cells have oval nucleithat often show mitotic figures; they continuously undergo cell division to replace cells that move outward through the epidermis. The next layer, the stratum spinosum, is several cells thick and has polyhedral cells that become progressively flatter toward the surface. Cell shrinkage caused by a fixation artifact accentuates the processes and creates spines or prickles —thus the name prickle cells . The next layer, the stratum granulosum, consists of three to five layers of flattened cells, their axes aligned parallel to the epidermal surface. They contain numerous basophilic granule , the keratohyalin granules. Superficial to this layer is a thin, translucent, lightly eosinophilic layer, known as the stratum lucidum. Absent in thin skin but present in thick skin, it consists of a few layers of tightly packed squamous cells that lack organelles and nuclei. The outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is made of dead, anucleate cornified cells; its thickness varies regionally. The protein keratin replaces cytoplasm in its cells. The most superficial cells are continuously shed in a process known as desquamation (Figs. 2A to C).
Fig. 2B ??LM of thick skin at the dermoepidermal junction. A thick keratin layer characterizes the outermost stratum corneum. A dermal papilla that projects superficially into the epidermal region consists of loose connective tissue of the papillary layer. This layer contains many small blood vessels and a Meissner corpuscle (MC), which is an encapsulated touch receptor. H&E. 

Fig. 2C ??Higher magnification LM of the epidermis of thick skin. The epidermis, a continually renewing epithelium, shows progressive differentiation and keratinization in a basal to superficial direction. Main features of its layers—strata basale (SB), spinosum (SS) (note prickle cells), granulosum (SG), and a small part of the corneum (SC)—are seen here. Part of the underlying dermis appears at the bottom. H&E.
The dermis, a richly vascularized connective tissue, provides mechanical support, pliability , and tensile strength to skin. Blood vessels furnish nutrients and are involved in thermoregulation . The thick dermis is divided into two layers: a superficial papillary layer of loose connective tissue containing type I and III collagen fibers interspersed with elastic fibers, connective tissue cells, and rich network of capillaries; and a deeper reticular layer of dense irregular connective tissue consisting of coarse, interlacing bundles of collagen fibers, mostly type I. Aside from fibroblasts , other connective tissue cells in the dermis include macrophages, mast cells, adipocytes, plasma cells, and lymphocytes.
????A rich nerve supply throughout the dermis includes a complex network of sensory nerves and efferent sympathetic innervation to sweat glands, vascular smooth muscles, and arrector pili muscles . Myelinated nerve fibers supply nerve endings to the epidermis and encapsulated sensory receptors in the dermis including Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. Located in dermal papillae, Meissner corpuscles are mechanoreceptors that mediate touch. Pacinian corpuscles are larger encapsulated receptors in deeper regions of dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
?Eccrine sweat glands are simple, coiled tubular glands consisting of secretory and narrower excretory duct portions. With cholinergic innervation, they mainly serve a thermoregulatory role and maintain body temperature by evaporative heat loss. They also aid ion excretion and may, under normal conditions, produce 500-750 mL or more of sweat daily in response to thermal and emotional stimuli (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 ??LM of an eccrine sweat gland in the dermis. In the transverse and oblique sections of the coiled secretory portion (Se) of the gland, secretory cells have a relatively pale cytoplasm and border a prominent central lumen. Several smaller, more darkly stained profiles of the duct (Du) are seen with their characteristic double cuboidal epithelium. Surrounding dermis contains abundant capillaries (Cap). H&E 

????Apocrine sweat glands, also known as odoriferous sweat glands, are large, branched glands found in axillae , scrotum, prepuce, labia minora, nipples, and perianal regions. They are less coiled than eccrine sweat glands, and many coils anastomose to form an intertwining tubular network 5. The sac-like lumen of the secretory tubules is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium and, compared with the eccrine glands, has a wider diameter and larger, more numerous myoepithelial cells that share a basement membrane with secretory epithelium.
??Except for lips, palms , soles ,and a few other sites, hairs cover most of the body surface. They develop from epidermis, cross the dermis, and often extend into subcutaneous connective tissue. Each hair comprises a free shaft and a root, which is enclosed at its lower end by a tubular hairfollicle, composed of epidermal (epithelial) and dermal (connective tissue) parts. The long axis of each follicle usually lies oblique to the plane of the epidermal surface. Hairs are keratinized threads that vary in thickness and length depending on body region (Figs. 4A and B). 
Fig. 4A ??Pilosebaceous unit.
Fig. 4B ??LM of thin skin close to the epidermis. An arrector pili muscle (AP) and an associated pilosebaceous unit are shown sectioned tangentially. Because of the section level, the hair shaft is not seen. A sebaceous gland (SG) and its duct (arrow) open into the upper end of a hair follicle (HF). The external root sheath (ERS) is continuous with the epidermis (Ep) on the surface. The arrector pili muscle in the underlying dermis (De) extends obliquely from the base of the hair follicle to the papillary dermis. H&E.
Sebaceous glands are usually associated with hair and are located between a hair follicle and its arrector pili muscle in the dermis. They are holocrine glands in which part of the secretory product, known as sebum, is made of lipid-rich decomposed cells. Most sebaceous glands empty secretions by a duct into the upper part of the hair follicle near the hair shaft. These simple or branched alveolar glands are pale staining and ovoid . A thin connective tissue capsule surrounds each alveolus, several of which typically open into a common duct that is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is continuous with the outer epithelial root sheathof the hair follicle (Fig. 5).
Fig. 5 ??LM of a pilosebaceous unit. The base of the hair follicle (HF) has a terminal expansion–-the hair bulb. An associated sebaceous gland (SG) contains pale cells that show progressive enlargement and disintegration as they empty into a duct (arrow) at the upper end of the follicle. An optical artifact causes the hair shaft emanating from the hair follicle matrix to appear yellow. Surrounding dermis (De) is dense irregular connective tissue. H&E
Nails are modifications of the stratum corneum of the epidermis on the dorsal aspect of terminal phalanges of fingers and toes. The slightly convex , semitransparent nail plate is composed of multiple layers of squamous-shaped keratinized cells that are firmly held together. These cells contain hard keratin and do not desquamate. The undersurface of both exposed and concealed parts of the nail plate is the nail bed . It consists of stratum germinativum of the epidermis and underlying dense dermis, which lacks subcutaneous tissue but is firmly attached to periosteum of terminal phalanges (Figs. 6A to C).


Unit two Text B Introduction to the Developing Human-1&2

????Human development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte (ovum) from a female is fertilized by a sperm (spermatozoon) from a male. Cell division, cell migration, programmed cell death, differentiation, and growth, and cell rearrangement transform the fertilized oocyte, a highly specialized, totipotent cell, a zygote , into a multicellular human being. Although most developmental changes occur during the embryonic and fetal periods, important changes occur during later periods of development: infancy, childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Development does not stop at birth. Important changes, in addition to growth, occur after birth (e.g., development of teeth and female breasts).
????It is customary to divide human development into prenatal (before birth) and postnatal (after birth) periods. During the prenatal period, the most visible advances occur during the third to eighth weeks of embryonic development. During the fetal period, differentiation and growth of tissues and organs occur. The rate of body growth increases during this period.
Literally, embryology means the study of embryos; however, the term generally refers to prenatal development of embryos and fetuses. 
????Developmental anatomy is the field of embryology concerned with the changes that cells, tissues, organs, and the body as a whole undergo from a germ cell of each parent to the resulting adult . Prenatal development is more rapid than postnatal development and results in more striking changes.
????Teratology is the division of embryology and pathology that deals with abnormal development (birth defects). This branch of embryology is concerned with various genetic and/or environmental factors that disturb normal development and produce birth defects.
????Bridges the gap between prenatal development and obstetrics, perinatal medicine, pediatrics , and clinical anatomy. Develops knowledge concerning the beginnings of human life and the changes occurring during prenatal development. Is of practical value in helping to understand the causes of variations in human structure.Illuminates gross anatomy and explains how normal and abnormal relations develop.
Knowledge that physicians have of normal development and of the causes of anomalies is necessary for giving the embryo and fetus the greatest possible chance of developing normally. Much of the modern practice of obstetrics involves applied embryology. Embryologic topics of special interest to obstetricians are ovulation , oocyte and sperm transport , fertilization, implantation , fetal-maternal relations, fetal circulation, critical periods of development, and causes of birth defects. In addition to caring for the mother, physicians guard the health of the embryo and fetus. The significance of embryology is readily apparent to pediatricians because some of their patients have birth defects resulting from maldevelopment , e.g., diaphragmatic hernia, spina bifida, and congenital heart disease.
Developmental anomalies cause most deaths during infancy. Knowledge of the development of structure and function is essential for understanding the physiologic changes that occur during the newborn period and for helping fetuses and babies in distress. Progress in surgery, especially in the fetal, perinatal, and pediatric age groups, has made knowledge of human development even more clinically significant. Surgical treatment of the fetus is now possible. The understanding and correction of most congenital anomalies depend on knowledge of normal development and of the deviations that may occur. An understanding of common congenital anomalies and their causes also enables physicians, dentists, and other health care providers to explain the developmental basis of abnormalities, often dispelling parental guilt feelings.
Rapid advances in the field of molecular biology have led to the application of sophisticated techniques (e.g., recombinant DNA technology , chimeric models, transgenic mice, and stem cell manipulation ). These techniques are now widely used in research laboratories to address such diverse problems as the genetic regulation of morphogenesis , the temporal and regional expression of specific genes, and how cells are committed to form the various parts of the embryo. For the first time, we are beginning to understand how, when, and where selected genes are activated and expressed in the embryo during normal and abnormal development.
The first mammal , Dolly the sheep, was cloned in 1997 by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues using the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer. Since then, other animals have been successfully cloned from cultured differentiated adult cells. Interest in human cloning has generated considerable debate because of social, ethical, and legal implications. Moreover, there is concern that cloning may result in infants born with birth defects and serious diseases. 
????Human embryonic stem cells are pluripotential , capable of self-renewal, and are able to differentiate into specialized cell types. The isolation and programmed culture of human embryonic stem cells hold great potential for the treatment of degenerative, malignancy, and genetic diseases.
The English equivalents of the standard Latin forms of terms are given in some cases, e.g., sperm (spermatozoon). Eponyms commonly used clinically appear in parentheses, such as uterine tube(Fallopian tube). In anatomy and embryology, several terms relating to position and direction are used, and reference is made to various planes of the body . All descriptions of the adult are based on the assumption that the body is erect, with the upper limbs by the sides and the palms directed anteriorly (Fig. 1A). This is the anatomical position. The terms anterior or ventral and posterior or dorsal are used to describe the front or back of the body or limbs and the relations of structures within the body to one another. When describing embryos, the terms dorsal and ventral are used (Fig. 1B). Superior and inferior are used to indicate )the relative levels of different structures (Fig. 1A). For embryos, the terms cranial or rostral and caudal are used to denote14 relationships to the head and caudal eminence (tail), respectively (Fig. 1B). Distances from the source or attachment of a structure are designated as proximal or distal
?The median plane is an imaginary vertical plane of section that passes longitudinally through the body. Median sections divide the body into right and left halves (Fig. 1C). The terms lateral and medial refer to structures that are, respectively, farther from or nearer to the median plane of the body. A sagittal plane is any vertical plane passing through the body that is parallel to the median plane (Fig. 1C). A transverse (axial) plane refers to any plane that is at right angles to both the median and coronal planes (Fig. 1D). A frontal (coronal) plane is any vertical plane that intersects the median plane at a right angle (Fig. 1E) and divides the body into anterior or ventral and posterior or dorsal parts.

Unit three Text A Enzymes: Regulation of Activities1-1

BIOMEDICAL IMPORTANCE
????The 19th-century physiologist Claude Bernard2 enunciated the conceptual basis for metabolic regulation. He observed that living organisms respond in ways that are both quantitatively and temporally appropriate to permit them to survive the multiple challenges posed by changes in their external and internal environments3 . Walter Cannon4 subsequently coined the term "homeostasis" to describe the ability of animals to maintain a constant intracellular environment despite changes in their external environment5 . We now know that organisms respond to changes in their external and internal environment by balanced, coordinated changes in the rates of specific metabolic reactions. Many human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and Alzheimer's disease6 , are characterized by regulatory dysfunctions triggered by pathogenic agents or genetic mutations. For example, many oncogenic viruses elaborate protein-tyrosine kinases that modify the regulatory events that control patterns of gene expression, contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer. The toxin from Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera , disables sensor-response pathways7 in intestinal epithelial cells by ADP-ribosylating the GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) that link cell surface receptors to adenylyl cyclase . The consequent activation of the cyclase triggers the flow of water into the intestines, resulting in massive diarrhea and dehydration8. Yersinia pestis , the causative agent of plague , elaborates a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphoryl groups on key cytoskeletal proteins. Dysfunctions in the systems responsible for the degradation of defective or abnormal proteins are believed to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's9 . Knowledge of factors that control the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions thus is essential to an understanding of the molecular basis of disease.
REGULATION OF METABOLITE FLOW CAN BE ACTIVE OR PASSIVE
????Enzymes that operate at their maximal rate cannot respond to an increase in substrate concentration, and can respond only to a precipitous decrease in substrate concentration. For most enzymes, therefore, the average intracellular concentration of their substrate tends to be close to the Km value, so that changes in substrate concentration generate corresponding changes in metabolite flux (Fig. 1). Responses to changes in substrate level represent an important but passive means for coordinating metabolite flow and maintaining homeostasis in quiescent cells. However, they offer limited scope for responding to changes in environmental variables. The mechanisms that regulate enzyme activity in an active manner in response to internal and external signals are discussed below.
Fig. 1 ??Differential response of the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, △V, to the same incremental change in substrate concentration at a substrate concentration of Km (△VA) or far above Km (△VB).
Metabolite Flow Tends to Be Unidirectional 
????Despite the existence of short-term oscillations in metabolite concentrations and enzyme levels, living cells exist in a dynamic steady state in which the mean concentrations of metabolic intermediates remain relatively constant over time (Fig. 2). While all chemical reactions are to some extent reversible , in living cells the reaction products serve as substrates for—and are removed by—other enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Many nominally reversible reactions thus occur unidirectionally. This succession of coupled10 metabolic reactions is accompanied by an overall change in free energy that favors unidirectional metabolite flow. The unidirectional flow of metabolites through a pathway with a large overall negative change in free energy is analogous to the flow of water through a pipe in which one end is lower than the other11. Bends or kinks in the pipe simulate individual enzyme-catalyzed steps with a small negative or positive change in free energy. Flow of water through the pipe nevertheless remains unidirectional due to the overall change in height, which corresponds to the overall change in free energy in a pathway (Fig. 3).
Fig. 2 ??An idealized cell in steady state. Note that metabolite flow is unidirectional.
Fig. 3 ??Hydrostatic analogy for a pathway with a rate-limiting step (A) and a step with a △G value near zero (B)
PROTEASES MAY BE SECRETED AS CATALYTICALLY INACTIVE PROENZYMES 
????Certain proteins are synthesized and secreted as inactive precursor proteins known as proproteins. The proproteins of enzymes are termed proenzymes or zymogens. Selective proteolysis converts a proprotein by one or more successive proteolytic "clips12" to a form that exhibits the characteristic activity of the mature protein, e.g., its enzymatic activity. Proteins synthesized as proproteins include the hormone insulin (proprotein= proinsulin ), the digestive enzymes pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin (proproteins=pepsinogen, trypsinogen, and chymotrypsinogen, respectively), several factors of the blood clotting and blood clot dissolution cascades, and the connective tissue protein collagen (proprotein=procollagen).
The synthesis and secretion of proteases as catalytically inactive proenzymes protects the tissue of origin (e.g., the pancreas13 ) from autodigestion, such as can occur in pancreatitis. Certain physiologic processes such as digestion are intermittent but fairly regular and predictable. Others such as blood clot formation, clot dissolution, and tissue repair are brought "on line"14 only in response to pressing physiologic or pathophysiologic need. The processes of blood clot formation and dissolution clearly must be temporally coordinated to achieve homeostasis. Enzymes needed intermittently but rapidly often are secreted in an initially inactive form since the secretion process or new synthesis of the required proteins might be insufficiently rapid for response to a pressing pathophysiologic demand such as the loss of blood.
Activation of Prochymotrypsin Requires Selective Proteolysis
????Selective proteolysis involves one or more highly specific proteolytic clips that may or may not be accompanied by separation of the resulting peptides. Most importantly,selective proteolysis often results in conformational changes that "create" the catalytic site of an enzyme. Note that while His 57 and Asp 102 reside on the B peptide of α-chymotrypsin, Ser 195 resides on the C peptide (Fig. 4)15. The conformational changes that accompany selective proteolysis of prochymotrypsin (chymotrypsinogen) align the three residues of the charge -relay network, forming the catalytic site. Note also that contact and catalytic residues can be located on different peptide chains but still be within bond-forming distance of bound substrate.
Fig.4 Selective proteolysis and associated conformational changes form the active site of chymotrypsin, which includes the Asp 102- His57-Ser 195 catalytic triad. Successive proteolysis forms prochymotrypsin (pro-CT), π-chymotrypsin (π-CT), and ultimately α-chymotrypsin (α-CT), an active protease whose three peptides remain associated by covalent inter-chain disulfide bonds.
Homeostasis involves maintaining a relatively constant intracellular and intra-organ environment despite wide fluctuations in the external environment via appropriate changes in the rates of biochemical reactions in response to physiologic need.
????The substrates for most enzymes are usually present at a concentration close to Km. This facilitates passive control of the rates of product formation in response to changes in levels of metabolic intermediates.
????Active control of metabolite flux involves changes in the concentration, catalytic activity, or both of an enzyme that catalyzes a committed, rate-limiting reaction.
????Selective proteolysis of catalytically inactive proenzymes initiates conformational changes that form?the active site. Secretion as an inactive proenzyme?facilitates rapid mobilization of activity in response?to injury or physiologic need and may protect the?tissue of origin (e.g., autodigestion by proteases).
Unit three Text B Recombinant DNA Technology Involves Isolation & Manipulation of DNA to Make Chimeric Molecules-1&21

????Isolation and manipulation of DNA, including end-to-end joining of sequences from very different sources to make chimeric molecules (e.g., molecules containing both human and bacterial DNA sequences in a sequence-independent fashion), is the essence of recombinant DNA research2 . This involves several unique techniques and reagents.

????Certain endonucleases —enzymes that cut DNA at specific DNA sequences within the molecule (as opposed to exonucleases , which digest4 from the ends of DNA molecules)—are a key tool in recombinant DNA research. These enzymes were called restriction enzymes because their presence in a given bacterium restricted the growth of certain bacterial viruses called bacteriophages. Restriction enzymes cut DNA of any source into short pieces in a sequence-specific manner—in contrast to most other enzymatic, chemical, or physical methods, which break DNA randomly. These defensive enzymes (hundreds have been discovered) protect the host bacterial DNA from DNA from foreign organisms (primarily infective phages5). However, they are present only in cells that also have a companion enzyme which methylates the host DNA, rendering it an unsuitable substrate for digestion by the restriction enzyme6. Thus, site-specific DNA methylases and restriction enzymes always exist in pairs in a bacterium.
RESTRICTION ENZYMES & DNA LIGASE ARE USED TO PREPARE CHIMERIC DNA MOLECULES
????Sticky-end7 ligation is technically easy, but some special techniques are often required to overcome problems inherent in this approach. Sticky ends of a vector8 may reconnect with themselves, with no net gain of DNA9. Sticky ends of fragments can also anneal , so that tandem heterogeneous inserts form. Also, sticky-end sites may not be available or in a convenient position. To circumvent these problems, an enzyme that generates blunt ends is used, and new ends are added using the enzyme terminal transferase10. If poly d(G) is added to the 3' ends of the vector and poly d(C)11 is added to the 3' ends of the foreign DNA, the two molecules can only anneal to each other, thus circumventing the problems listed above. This procedure is called homopolymer tailing12. Sometimes, synthetic blunt-ended duplex oligonucleotide linkers with a convenient restriction enzyme sequence are ligated to the blunt-ended DNA. Direct blunt-end ligation is accomplished using the enzyme bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. This technique, though less efficient than sticky-end ligation, has the advantage of joining together any pairs of ends. The disadvantages are that there is no control over the orientation of insertion or the number of molecules annealed together, and there is no easy way to retrieve the insert.
CLONING AMPLIFIES DNA
????A clone is a large population of identical molecules, bacteria, or cells that arise from a common ancestor. Molecular cloning allows for the production of a large number of identical DNA molecules, which can then be characterized or used for other purposes. This technique is based on the fact that chimeric or hybrid DNA molecules can be constructed in cloning vectors—typically bacterial plasmids), phages, or cosmids—which then continue to replicate in a host cell under their own control systems. In this way, the chimeric DNA is amplified. The general procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.
Fig.1 Use of restriction nucleases to make new recombinant or chimeric DNA molecules. When inserted back into a bacterial cell (by the process called transformation), typically only a single plasmid is taken up by a single cell, and the plasmid DNA replicates not only itself but also the physically linked new DNA insert. Since recombining the sticky ends, as indicated, regenerates the same DNA sequence recognized by the original restriction enzyme, the cloned DNA insert can be cleanly cut back out of the recombinant plasmid circle with this endonuclease. If a mixture of all of the DNA pieces created by treatment of total human DNA with a single restriction nuclease is used as the source of human DNA, a million or so different types of recombinant DNA molecules can be obtained, each pure in its own bacterial clone.

Bacterial plasmids are small, circular, duplex DNA molecules whose natural function is to confer antibiotic resistance to the host cell. Plasmids have several properties that make them extremely useful as cloning vectors. They exist as single or multiple copies within the bacterium and replicate independently from the bacterial DNA. The complete DNA sequence of many plasmids is known; hence, the precise location of restriction enzyme cleavage sites for inserting the foreign DNA is available. Plasmids are smaller than the host chromosome and are therefore easily separated from the latter, and the desired plasmid-inserted DNA is readily removed by cutting the plasmid with the enzyme specific for the restriction site into which the original piece of DNA was inserted13.
????Phages usually have linear DNA molecules into which foreign DNA can be inserted at several restriction enzyme sites. The chimeric DNA is collected after the phage proceeds through its lytic cycle and produces mature, infective phage particles. A major advantage of phage vectors is that while plasmids accept DNA pieces about 6–10 kb long, phages can accept DNA fragments 10–20 kb14 long, a limitation imposed by15 the amount of DNA that can be packed into the phage head.
?Larger fragments of DNA can be cloned in cosmids, which combine the best features of plasmids and phages. Cosmids are plasmids that contain the DNA sequences, so-called cos sites, required for packaging lambda DNA into the phage particle. These vectors grow in the plasmid form in bacteria, but since much of the unnecessary lambda DNA has been removed, more chimeric DNA can be packaged into the particle head. It is not unusual for cosmids to carry inserts of chimeric DNA that are 35-50 kb long. Even larger pieces of DNA can be incorporated into bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), or E. coil bacteriophage Pl-based (PAC)16 vectors. These vectors will accept and propagate DNA inserts of several hundred kilobases or more and have largely replaced the plasmid, phage, and cosmid vectors for some cloning and gene mapping applications. A comparison of these vectors is shown in Table 1. 
Table 1 Cloning Capacities of Common Cloning Vector.
?Because insertion of DNA into a functional region of the vector will interfere with the action of this region, care must be taken not to interrupt an essential function of the vector. This concept can be exploited, however, to provide a selection technique. For example, the common plasmid vector pBR322 has both tetracycline (tet) and ampicillin (amp) resistance genes. A single PstI restriction enzyme site within the amp resistance gene is commonly used as the insertion site for a piece of foreign the DNA inserted at this site disrupts17 the amp resistance gene and makes the bacterium carrying this plasmid amp-sensitive (Fig. 2). Thus, the parental plasmid, which provides resistance to both antibiotics, can be readily separated from the chimeric plasmid, which is resistant only to tetracycline. YACs contain selection, replication, and segregation functions that work in both bacteria and yeast cells and therefore can be propagated in either organism.
Fig.2????A method of screening recombinants for inserted DNA fragments. Using the plasmid pBR322, a piece of DNA is inserted into the unique Pstl site. This inserting disrupts the gene coding for a protein that provides ampicillin resistance to the host bacterium. Hence, the chimeric plasmid will no longer survive when plated on a substrate medium that contains this antibiotic. The differential sensitivity to tetracycline and ampicillin can therefore be used to distinguish clones of plasmid that contain an insert. A similar scheme relying upon production of an in-frame fusion of a newly inserted DNA producing a peptide fragment capable of complementing an inactive, deleted form of the enzyme β-galactosidase allows for blue-white colony formation on agar plated containing a dye hydrolysable by β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase-positive colonies are blue; such colonies contain plasmids in which a DNA was successfully inserted.
A LIBRARY18 IS A COLLECTION OF RECOMBINANT CLONES
????The combination of restriction enzymes and various cloning vectors allows the entire genome of an organism to be packed into a vector. A collection of these different recombinant clones is called a library. A genomic library is prepared from the total DNA of a cell line or tissue. A cDNA19 library comprises complementary DNA copies of the population of mRNAs in a tissue. Genomic DNA libraries are often prepared by performing partial digestion of total DNA with a restriction enzyme that cuts DNA frequently (e.g., a four base cutter such as TaqI). The idea is to generate rather large fragments so that most genes will be left intact. The BAC, YAC, and Pl vectors are preferred since they can accept very large fragments of DNA and thus offer a better chance of isolating an intact gene on a single DNA fragment.
????A vector in which the protein coded by the gene introduced by recombinant DNA technology is actually synthesized is known as an expression vector. Such vectors are now commonly used to detect specific cDNA molecules in libraries and to produce proteins by genetic engineering techniques. These vectors are specially constructed to contain very active inducible promoters , proper in-phase translation20 initiation codons , both transcription and translation termination signals, and appropriate protein processing signals, if needed. Some expression vectors even contain genes that code for protease inhibitors , so that the final yield of product is enhanced.
?A variety of molecules can be used to "probe" libraries in search of a specific gene or cDNA molecule or to define and quantitate DNA or RNA separated by electrophoresis through various gels. Probes are generally pieces of DNA or RNA labeled with a P-containing nucleotide—or fluorescently labeled nucleotides (more commonly now). Importantly, neither modification (P or fluorescent-label) affects the hybridization properties of the resulting labeled nucleic acid probes. The probe must recognize a complementary sequence to be effective. A cDNA synthesized from a specific mRNA can be used to screen either a cDNA library for a longer cDNA or a genomic library for a complementary sequence in the coding region21 of a gene. A popular technique for finding specific genes entails taking a short amino acid equence and, employing the codon usage for that species, making an oligonucleotide probe that will detect the corresponding DNA fragment in a genomic library. If the sequences match exactly, probes 15-20 nucleotides long will hybridize. cDNA probes are used to detect DNA fragments on Southern blot22 transfers and to detect and quantitate RNA on Northern transfers and to detect and quantitate RNA on Northern blot transfers. Specific antibodies can also be used as probes provided that the vector used synthesizes protein molecules that are recognized by them.

Unit four Text A A Society of Cells-11

CELLS: THE BASIC UNITS OF LIVING ORGANISMS 
????The simplest structural units into which a complex multicellular organism can be divided and which still retain the functions characteristic of life are called cells2 . One of the unifying generalizations of biology is that certain fundamental activities are common to almost all cells and represent the minimal requirements for maintaining cell integrity and life3. Thus, for example, a human liver cell and an ameba are remarkably similar in their means of exchanging materials with their immediate environments4, of obtaining energy from organic nutrients, of synthesizing complex molecules, of duplicating themselves, and of detecting and responding to signals in their immediate environment.
?Each human organism begins as a single cell, a fertilized egg, which divides5 to create two cells, each of which divides in turn, resulting in four cells, and so on. If cell multiplication were the only event occurring, the end result would be a spherical mass of identical cells. During development, however, each cell becomes specialized for the performance of a particular function, such as producing force and movement (muscle cells) or generating electric signals (nerve cells)6 . The process of transforming an unspecialized cell into a specialized cell is known as cell differentiation , the study of which is one of the most exciting areas in biology today. As described earlier, all cells in a person have the same genes; how then is one unspecialized cell instructed to differentiate into a nerve cell, another into a muscle cell, and so on7? What are the external chemical signals that constitute these "instructions," and how do they affect various cells differently? For the most part, the answers to these questions are unknown.
??In addition to differentiating, cells migrate8 to new locations during development and form selective adhesions with other cells to produce multicellular structures. In this manner, the cells of the body are arranged in various combinations to form a hierarchy of organized structures. Differentiated cells with similar properties aggregate to form tissues, which combine with other types of tissues to form organs, which are linked together to form organ systems (Fig. 1).
Fig.1 Levels of cellular organization.

????About 200 distinct kinds of cells can be identified in the body in terms of differences in structure and function. When cells are classified according to the broad types of function they perform, however, four categories emerge: (1) muscle cells, (2) nerve cells, (3) epithelial cells, and (4) connective-tissue cells. In each of these functional categories, there are several cell types that perform variations of the specialized function. For example, there are three types of muscle cells—skeletal, cardiac, and smooth9— which differ from each other in shape, in the mechanisms controlling their contractile activity, and in their location in the various organs of the body.
Muscle cells are specialized to generate the mechanical forces that produce force and movement. Nerve cells are specialized to initiate and conduct electric signals, often over long distances. Epithelial cells are specialized for the selective secretion and absorption of ions and organic molecules. Connective-tissue cells, as their name implies, have as their major function connecting, anchoring, and supporting the structures of the body10.
Tissues
????Most specialized cells are associated with other cells of a similar kind to form tissues. Corresponding to the four general categories of differentiated cells, there are four general classes of tissues: (1) muscle tissue, (2) nerve tissue, (3) epithelial tissue, and (4) connective tissue. It should be noted that the term "tissue" is used in different ways. It is formally defined as an aggregate of a single type of specialized cell. However, it is also commonly used to denote the general cellular fabric of any organ or structure, for example, kidney tissue or lung tissue, each of which in fact usually contains all four classes of tissue.
The immediate environment of each individual cell in the body is the extracellular fluid. Actually this fluid is interspersed within a complex extracellular matrix consisting of a mixture of protein molecules (and, in some cases, minerals) specific for any given tissue11. The matrix serves two general functions: (1) It provides a scaffold for cellular attachments, and (2) it transmits to the cells information, in the form of chemical messengers, that helps regulate their migration, growth, and differentiation12.
???? The proteins of the extracellular matrix consist of fibers—ropelike collagen fibers and rubber band-like elastin fibers —and a mixture of other proteins that contain chains of complex sugars(carbohydrates) . In some ways, the extracellular matrix is analogous to reinforced concrete. The fibers of the matrix, particularly collagen, which constitutes one-third of all bodily proteins, are like the reinforcing iron mesh or rods in the concrete, and the carbohydrate-containing protein molecules are the surrounding cement13. However, these latter molecules are not merely inert "packing material," as in concrete, but function as adhesion/recognition molecules between cells and as important links in the communication between extracellular messenger molecules and cells.
ORGANS AND ORGAN SYSTEMS
???? Organs are composed of the four kinds of tissues arranged in various proportions and patterns: sheets, tubes, layers, bundles, strips, and so on. Many organs are organized into small, similar sub-units often referred to as functional units, each performing the function of the organ. 
????Finally we have the organ system, a collection of organs that together perform an overall function. For example, the kidneys, the urinary bladder, the tubes leading from the kidneys to the bladder, and the tube leading from the bladder to the exterior constitute the urinary system.
????To sum up, the human body can be viewed as a complex society of differentiated cells structurally and functionally combined and interrelated to carry out the functions essential to the survival of the entire organism14. The individual cells constitute the basic units of this society, and almost all of these cells individually exhibit the fundamental activities common to all forms of life. Indeed, many of the cells can be removed and maintained in test tubes15 as free-living organisms (this is termed in vitro , literally "in glass," as opposed to in vivo , meaning "within the body").

Unit four Text B Erythrocytes-1&21

????The major functions of erythrocytes are to carry oxygen taken in by the lungs and carbon dioxide produced by cells. Erythrocytes contain large amounts of the protein hemoglobin with which oxygen and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide reversibly combine. Oxygen binds to2 iron atoms (Fe) in the hemoglobin molecules. The average concentration3 of hemoglobin is 14 g/100ml4 blood in women and 16 g/100 ml in men. 
????Erythrocytes have the shape of a biconcave disk—that is, a disk thicker at the edges than in the middle, like a doughnut with a center depression on each side instead of a hole (Fig. 1). This shape and their small size (7 μm in diameter) impart to the erythrocytes a high surface-to-volume ratio5, so that oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse rapidly to and from the interior of the cell. The plasma membrane of erythrocytes contains specific polysaccharides and proteins that differ from person to person, and these confer upon the blood its so-called type, or group6.
?The site of erythrocyte production is the soft interior of bones called bone marrow specifically the "red" bone marrow. With differentiation, the erythrocyte precursors produce hemoglobin but then they ultimately lose their nuclei and organelles —their machinery for protein synthesis. Young erythrocytes in the bone marrow still contain a few ribosomes , which produce a web-like(reticular) appearance when treated with special stains, an appearance that gives these young erythrocytes the name reticulocyte Normally, only mature erythrocytes, which have lost these ribosomes, leave the bone marrow and enter the general circulation7. In the presence of unusually rapid erythrocyte production8 , however, many reticulocytes do enter the blood, a fact of clinical diagnostic usefulness.
Because erythrocytes lack nuclei and organelles, they can neither reproduce themselves nor maintain their normal structure for very long. The average life span9 of an erythrocyte is approximately 120 days, which means that almost 1 percent of the body's erythrocytes are destroyed and must be replaced every day. This amounts to 250 billion cells per day10! Erythrocyte destruction normally occurs in the spleen and the liver. As will be described below, most of the iron released in the process is conserved. The major breakdown product of hemoglobin is bilirubin, which gives plasma its color. 
????The production of erythrocytes requires the usual nutrients needed to synthesize any cell: amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In addition, both iron and certain growth factors, including the vitamins folic acid and vitamin B12, are essential.
?As noted above, iron is the element to which oxygen binds on a hemoglobin molecule within an erythrocyte. Small amounts of iron are lost from the body via the urine, feces, sweat, and cells sloughed from the skin. In addition, women lose an additional amount via menstrual blood. In order to remain in iron balance, the amount of iron lost from the body must be replaced by ingestion of iron-containing11 oods; particularly rich sources are meat, liver, shellfish, egg yolk , beans, nuts, and cereals . A significant upset of iron balance can result either in iron deficiency, leading to inadequate hemoglobin production, or in an excess of iron in the body, with serious toxic effects (hemochromatosis).
????The homeostatic control of iron balance resides primarily in12 the intestinal epithelium, which actively absorbs iron from ingested foods. Normally, only a small fraction of ingested iron is absorbed, but more importantly, this fraction is increased or decreased, in a negative feedback manner, depending upon the state of the body's iron balance—the more iron in the body, the less ingested iron is absorbed. 
The body has a considerable store of iron, mainly in the liver, bound up in a protein called ferritin. Ferritin serves as a buffer13 against iron deficiency. About 50 percent of the total body iron is in hemoglobin, 25 percent is in other heme-containing proteins (mainly the cytochromes) in the cells of the body, and 25 percent is in liver ferritin. Moreover, the recycling of iron is very efficient (Fig. 2). As old erythrocytes are destroyed in the spleen (and liver), their iron is released into the plasma and bound to an iron-transport plasma protein called transferrin . Almost all of this iron is delivered by transferrin to the bone marrow to be incorporated into14 new erythrocytes. Recirculation of erythrocyte iron is very important because it involves 20 times more iron per day than is absorbed and excreted15 . On a much lesser scale, nonerythrocyte cells, some of which are continuously dying and being replaced, release iron from their cytochromes into the plasma and take up iron from it, transferrin serving as a carrier16.
?FOLIC ACID AND VITAMIN B12 Folic acid, a vitamin found in large amounts in leafy plants, yeast, and liver, is required for synthesis of the nucleotide base thymine. It is, therefore, essential for the formation of DNA and hence for normal cell division. When this vitamin is not present in adequate amounts,impairment of cell division occurs throughout the body but is most striking in rapidly proliferating cells, including erythrocyte precursors. Thus, fewer erythrocytes are produced when folic acid is deficient. 
????Production of normal erythrocyte numbers also requires extremely small quantities (one-millionth of a gram per day) of a cobalt -containing molecule, vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin ), since this vitamin is required for the action of folic acid. Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products, and strictly vegetarian diets are deficient in it. Also, the absorption of vitamin B12 from the gastrointestinal tract requires a protein called intrinsic factor17, which is secreted by the stomach; lack of this protein also causes vitamin B12 deficiency.
?REGULATION OF ERYTHROCYTE PRODUCTION In a normal person, the total volume of circulating erythrocytes remains remarkably constant because of reflexes that regulate the bone marrow's production of these cells. In the previous section, we stated that iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 must be present for normal erythrocyte production. However, none of these substances constitutes the signal that regulates production rate.
????The direct control of erythrocyte production (erythropoiesis) is exerted primarily by a hormone called erythropoietin, which is secreted into the blood mainly by a particular group of hormone-secreting connective-tissue cells in the kidneys (the liver also secretes this hormone, but to a much lesser extent). Erythropoietin acts on the bone marrow to stimulate the proliferation of erythrocyte progenitor cells and their differentiation into mature erythrocytes18.
Fig.2 Summary of iron balance. The thickness of the arrows corresponds approximately to the amount of iron involved. In the steady state, the rate of gastrointestinal iron absorption equals the rate of iron loss via urine, skin, and menstrual flow. Adapted from Crosby19
?Erythropoietin is normally secreted in relatively small amounts, which stimulate the bone marrow to produce erythrocytes at a rate adequate to replace the usual loss. The erythropoietin secretion rate is increased markedly above basal values20 when there is a decreased oxygen delivery to the kidneys. Situations in which this occurs include insufficient pumping of blood by the heart, lung disease, anemia (a decrease in number of erythrocytes or in hemoglobin concentration), and exposure to high altitude . As a result of the increase in erythropoietin secretion, plasma erythropoietin concentration, erythrocyte production, and the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood all increase; therefore, oxygen delivery to the tissues returns toward normal (Fig. 3).
Fig.3 Reflex by which a decreased oxygen delivery to the kidneys increases erythrocyte production via increased erythropoietin secretion. 

????Testosterone , the male sex hormone, also stimulates the release of erythropoietin. This accounts, at least in part, for the higher hemoglobin concentration in men than in women.
????Anemia Anemia is defined as a decrease in the ability of the blood to carry oxygen due to (1) a decrease in the total number of erythrocytes, each having a normal quantity of hemoglobin, or (2) a diminished concentration of hemoglobin per erythrocyte, or (3) a combination of both. Anemia has a wide variety of causes summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1 Major causes of anemia.
Finally, there also exist conditions in which the problem is just the opposite of anemia, namely, more erythrocytes than normal; this is termed polycythemia. An example is the polycythemia that occurs in high-altitude dwellers; in this case the increased number of erythrocytes is an adaptive response. However, the existence of polycythemia makes the flow of blood through blood vessels more difficult.

Unit five Text A Cells Involved in the Immune Response-1&21

????The fully developed immune system of humans and most mammals is constituted by a variety of cells and tissues whose different functions are remarkably well-integrated. Among the cells, the lymphocytes play the key roles in the control and regulation of immune responses as well as in the recognition of infected or heterologous cells, which the lymphocytes can recognize as undesirable and promptly eliminate.
CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
Lymphocytes
????Lymphocytes (Fig. 1A) occupy a very special place among the leukocytes that participate in one way or another in immune reactions due to their ability to interact specifically with antigenic substances and to react to nonself antigenic determinants2 . Lymphocytes differentiate from stem cells in the fetal liver, bone marrow, and thymus into two main functional classes. They are found in the peripheral blood and in all lymphoid tissues.

B Lymphocytes 
????B lymphocytes or B cells are so designated because the bursa of Fabricius , a lymphoid organ located close to the caudal end of the gut in birds, plays a key role in their differentiation. Removal of this organ, at or shortly before hatching, is associated with lack of differentiation, maturation of B lymphocytes, and the inability to produce antibodies. A mammalian counterpart to the avian bursa has not yet been found. Some investigators believe that the bone marrow is the most likely organ for B lymphocyte differentiation, while others propose that the peri-intestinal lymphoid tissues play this role. 
????B lymphocytes carry immunoglobulins on their cell membrane, which function as antigen receptors. After proper stimulation, B cells undergo blastogenic transformation and after several rounds of division differentiate into antibody producing cells (plasma cells). Activated B lymphocytes may also play the role of antigen-presenting cells (APC), which is usually attributed to cells of monocytic/macrophagic lineage3.
T Lymphocytes
????T lymphocytes or T cells are so designated because the thymus plays a key role in their differentiation. The functions of the T lymphocytes include the regulation of immune responses, and various effector functions4 (cytotoxicity and lymphokine production being the main ones) that are the basis of cell-mediated immunity5. T lymphocytes also carry an antigen-recognition unit on their membranes, known as T cell receptors (TcR). TcR and immunoglobulin molecules are structurally unrelated. 
Fig.1Morphology of the main types of human leukocytes. (A) lymphocyte; (B) plasma cell; (C) monocyte; (D) granulocyte.

????T lymphocyte activation requires the interaction of the T cell receptor with an antigen-derived polypeptide and additional costimulatory signals from auxiliary cells6. When properly stimulated, a small, resting T lymphocyte rapidly undergoes blastogenic transformation into a large lymphocyte (13–15 ?m). This large lymphocyte (lymphoblast) then divides several times to produce an expanded population of medium (9–12 ?m) and small lymphocytes (5–8 ?m) with the same antigenic specificity. Activated and differentiated T lymphocytes are morphologically indistinguishable from a small, resting lymphocyte.
Plasma Cells 
????Plasma cells are morphologically characterized by their eccentric nuclei with clumped chromatin , and a large cytoplasm with abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1B). Plasma cells produce and secrete large amounts of immunoglobulins, but do not express7 membrane immunoglobulins. Plasma cells seldom divide, if at all8 . Plasma cells are usually found in the bone marrow and in the perimucosal lymphoid tissues. 
Natural Killer Cells 
????Natural killer (NK) cells9 morphologically are described as large granular lymphocytes. These cells do not carry antigen receptors of any kind, but can recognize antibody molecules bound to target cells and destroy those cells, using the same general mechanisms involved in T lymphocyte cytotoxicity (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity10). They also have a recognition mechanism that allows them to destroy tumor cells and virus-infected cells.
Antigen-Presenting Cells: Monocytes, Macrophages, and Dendritic Cells
????Monocytes and macrophages are believed to be closely related. The monocyte (Fig. 1C) is considered a leukocyte in transit11 through the blood, which, when fixed in a tissue, will become a macrophage. Monocytes and macrophages are able to ingest particulate matter (microorganisms, cells, and inert particles) and for this reason are said to have phagocytic functions. The phagocytic activity is greater in macrophages than in monocytes.
????Macrophages and monocytes play an important role in the inductive stages12 of the immune response by processing complex antigens and concentrating antigen fragments on the cell membrane13 . In this form, the antigen is recognized by helper T lymphocytes14. For this reason, these cells are known as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The most specialized and efficient APCs are the dendritic cells, which are also heterogenous, including at least two populations, one of myeloid origin and the other of lymphoid origin. Some dendritic cells tend to be present in tissues such as the kidney, brain (microglia), capillary walls , and mucosae. In the resting state, they seem very inefficient as APCs, but after activation by microbial substance or other stimuli they migrate to the lymphoid tissues, where they differentiate into efficient APCs, able to stimulate na?ve T cells14.
Granulocytes 
????Granulocytes are a collection of white blood cells with segmented or lobulated nuclei and granules in their cytoplasm, which are visible with special stains. Because of their segmented nuclei, which assume15 variable sizes and shapes, these cells are generically designated as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes (Fig. 1D). Different subpopulations of granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) can be distinguished by differential generically designated as staining16 of the cytoplasmic granules, reflecting their different chemical constitution.
Neutrophils 
????Neutrophils are the largest subpopulation of white blood cells and have two types of cytoplasmic granules containing compounds17 with bactericidal activity. Their biological importance derives from their phagocytic activity. Similar to most other phagocytic cells, they ingest with greatest efficiency microorganisms and particulate matter coated by antibody and complement18. 
Eosinophils 
????Eosinophils are PMN leukocytes with granules that stain orange–red with cytological stains containing eosin . These cells are found in high concentrations19 in allergic reactions and during parasitic infections. 
Basophils 
????Basophils have granules that stain metachromatically due to their contents of histamine and heparin. The tissue-fixed mast cells20 are very similar to basophils, even though they appear to evolve from different precursor cells. Both basophils and mast cells are involved in antiparasitic immune mechanisms and play a key pathogenic role in allergic reactions.

Unit five Text B Introduction to Immunology-11

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
????The fundamental observation that led to the development of immunology as a scienti?c discipline was that an individual might become resistant for life to a certain disease after having contracted2 it only once. The term immunity, derived from the Latin "immunis" (exempt), was adopted to designate this naturally acquired3 protection against diseases such as measles or smallpox.
The emergence of immunology as a discipline was closely tied to the development of microbiology. The work of Pasteur, Koch, Metchnikoff4, and many other pioneers of the golden age of microbiology resulted in the rapid identi?cation of new infectious agents5. This was closely followed by the discovery that infectious diseases could be prevented by exposure to killed or attenuated organisms, or to compounds extracted from the infectious agents. The impact of immunization against infectious diseases such as tetanus, measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, and smallpox, to name just a few examples, can be grasped when we re?ect on the fact that these diseases, which were signi?cant causes of mortality and morbidity, are now either extinct or very rarely seen6. Indeed, it is fair to state that the impact of vaccination and sanitation on the welfare and life expectancy of humans has had no parallel in any other developments of medical science7.
?In the second part of this microbiology. The work of Pasteur, Koch, century8, immunology started to transcend its early boundaries and become a more general biomedical discipline. Today, the study of immunological defense mechanisms is still an important area of research, but immunologists are involved in a much wider array of problems, such as self-nonself discrimination9, control of cell and tissue differentiation, transplantation, cancer immunotherapy, and so on. The focus of interest has shifted toward the basic understanding of how the immune system works in the hope that this insight will allow novel approaches to its manipulation10.
GENERAL CONCEPTS
Speci?c and Nonspeci?c Defenses11
????The protection of our organism against infectious agents involves many different mechanisms: some nonspeci?c (i.e., generically applicable to many different pathogenic organisms) and others speci?c (i.e., their protective effect is directed to one single organism). 
????Nonspeci?c defenses, which as a rule are innate (i.e., all normal individuals are born with them), include: Mechanical barriers such as the integrity12 of the epidermis and mucosal membranes; Physicochemical barriers, such as the acidity of the stomach ?uid; The antibacterial substances (e.g., lysozyme, defensins) present in external secretions; Normal intestinal transit and normal ?ow of bronchial secretions and urine, which eliminate infectious agents from the respective systems; and Nonimmune mechanisms for ingestion of bacteria and particulate matter by a variety of cells, but particularly well developed in granulocytes.
Speci?c defenses, as a rule, are induced during the life of the individual as part of the complex sequence of events designated as the immune response. The immune response has two unique characteristics: Speci?city for the eliciting antigen. For example, immunization with inactivated poliovirus only protects against poliomyelitis, not against viral in?uenza. The speci?city of the immune response is due to the existence of exquisitely discriminative antigen receptors on lymphocytes. Memory, meaning that repeated exposure to a given antigen elicits progressively more intense speci?c responses. Most immunizations involve repeated administration13 of the immunizing compound, with the goal of establishing a long-lasting, protective response. The increase in the magnitude and duration of the immune response with repeated exposure to the same antigen is due to the proliferation of antigen-speci?c lymphocytes after each exposure.
Stages of the Immune Response 
????To better understand how the immune response is generated, it is useful to consider it as divided into separate sequential stages (Table 1). The ?rst stage (induction) involves a small lymphocyte population with speci?c receptors able to recognize an antigen or antigen fragments generated by specialized cells known as antigen-presenting cells (APC)14. The second stage (ampli?cation) is mediated15 by activated APCs and by specialized T cell subpopulations (T helper cells, de?ned below) which enhance each other's proliferation and differentiation. This is followed by the production of effector molecules (antibodies) or by the differentiation of effector cells (cells which directly or indirectly mediate the elimination of undesirable elements). The ?nal outcome, therefore, is the elimination of the organism or compound that triggered the reaction by means of activated immune cells or by reactions triggered by mediators released by the immune system16. 
Table 1 A simplified overview of the three main stages of the immune response.
Lymphocytes and Lymphocyte Sub-Populations 
????The peripheral blood contains two large populations of cells: the red cells, whose main physiological role is to carry oxygen to tissues, and the white blood cells, which have as their main physiological role the elimination of potentially harmful organisms or compounds. Among the white blood cells, lymphocytes are particularly important because of their central role in the immune response. Several subpopulations of lymphocytes have been de?ned: B lymphocytes, which are the precursors of antibody-producing cells, known as plasma cells.
T lymphocytes, which can be divided into several subpopulations: Helper T lymphocytes (Th), which play a very signi?cant ampli?cation role in the immune responses. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are the main immunologic effector mechanism involved in the elimination of non-self or infected cells. Immunoregulatory T lymphocytes, which have the ability to downregulate the immune response through the release of cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and through the expression of membrane molecules such as CTLA4, whose interaction with the corresponding receptors delivers a downregulatory signal17.
Antigen-Presenting Cells 
????APCs, such as the macrophages, macrophage-related cells, and dendritic cells, play a very signi?cant role in the induction stages of the immune response by trapping and presenting both native antigens and antigen fragments in a most favorable way for the recognition by lymphocytes18 . In addition, these cells also deliver activating signals to lymphocytes engaged in antigen recognition, both in the form of soluble mediators (interleukins, such as IL-1) and in the form of signals delivered by cell–cell contact. 
Phagocytic Cells 
????Phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, also play signi?cant roles as effectors of the immune response. One of their main functions is to eliminate antigens that have elicited an immune response. This is achieved by means of antibodies and complement. However, if the antigen is located on the surface of a cell, antibody induces the attachment of cytotoxic cells that cause the death of the antibody-coated cell [antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)]. 
Natural Killer Cells 
????Natural killer cells play a dual role19 in the elimination of infected and malignant cells. These cells are unique in that they have two different mechanisms of recognition: they can identify malignant or viral-infected cells by their decreased expression of histocompatibility antigens (HLA), and they can recognize antibody-coated cells and mediate ADCC.
ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES 
????Antigens are usually exogenous substances (cells, proteins, and polysaccharides ), which are recognized by receptors on lymphocytes, thereby eliciting the immune response. The receptor molecules located on the membrane of lymphocytes interact with small portions of those foreign cells or proteins that are designated as antigenic determinants or epitopes. An adult human being has the capability to recognize millions of different antigens, producing antibodies, proteins that appear in circulation after infection or immunization and that have the ability to react speci?cally with epitopes of the antigen introduced in the organism. Because antibodies are soluble and are present in virtually all body ?uids ("humors"), the term humoral immunity was introduced to designate the immune responses in which antibodies play the principal role as effector mechanism. Antibodies are also generically designated as immunoglobulins. This term derives from the fact that antibody molecules structurally belong to the family of proteins known as globulins(globular proteins) and from their involvement in immunity. If the antigen is soluble, the reaction with speci?c antibody under appropriate conditions results in precipitation of large antigen–antibody aggregates. If the antigen is expressed on a cell membrane, the cell will be cross-linked20 by antibody and form visible clumps (agglutination).
?Functionally, antigen–antibody reactions can be classi?ed by their biological consequences: Viruses and soluble toxins released by bacteria lose their infectivity or pathogenic properties after reaction with the corresponding antibodies (neutralization). Antibodies complexed with antigens can activate the complement system21 . Nine major proteins or components that are sequentially activated constitute this system. Some of the complement components are able to promote ingestion of microorganisms by phagocytic cells, while others are inserted into cytoplasmic membranes and cause their disruption, leading to lysis of the offending microbial cell. Antibodies can cause the destruction of microorganisms by promoting their ingestion by phagocytic cells or their destruction by cells mediating ADCC22. Phagocytosis is particularly important for the elimination of bacteria and involves the binding of antibodies and complement components to the outer surface of the infectious agent (opsonization) and recognition of the bound antibody and/or complement components as a signal for ingestion by the phagocytic cell. Antigen–antibody reactions are the basis of certain pathological conditions, such as allergic reactions. Antibody-mediated allergic reactions have a very rapid onset, in a matter of minutes, and are known as immediate pathological reactions.

Unit six Text A Introduction to Pathogens-11

????We normally think of pathogens as hostile invaders that attack our bodies. But a pathogen, like any other organism, is simply fulfilling its biological imperative2 to live and procreate. Living at the expense of a host3 organism is a very effective strategy, and it is possible that every living organism on earth is subject to some type of infection (Fig. 1). A human host is a nutrient-rich4, warm, and moist environment, which remains at a uniform temperature5 and constantly renews itself. It is not surprising that many microorganisms have evolved the ability to survive and reproduce in this desirable niche6.
Fig.1 Parasitism at many levels. (A) Scanning electron micrograph of a flea. The flea is a common parasite of mammals—including dogs, cats, rats, and humans. It drinks the blood of its host. Flea bites spread bubonic plague by passing the pathogenic bacterium Yersinia pestis from the bloodstream of one infected host to that of another. (B) A close-up view of this flea's leg reveals that it also has a parasite, a type of mite. The mite, in turn, is covered with bacteria. It is likely that bacteriophages, which are bacterial viruses, parasitize these bacteria.
The human body is a complex and thriving ecosystem . It contains about 1013 human cells7 and also about 1014 bacterial, fungal, and protozoan cells, which represent thousands of microbial species. These commensal microbes, called the normal flora, are usually confined to certain areas of the body8, including the skin, mouth, large intestine, and vagina. The normal flora are not just freeloading inhabitants of the ecosystem that is the human body; they can also affect our health9. The anaerobic bacteria that inhabit our intestines contribute to the digestion of food, and they are also essential for proper development of the gastrointestinal tract in infants. Normal flora on the skin and elsewhere also help us by competing with disease-causing microorganisms10. In addition, humans are always infected with viruses, the vast majority of which rarely become noticeable.
?If it is normal for us to live in such close intimacy with a wide variety of microbes11, why are some of them capable of causing us illness or death? As we shall see, this question has several answers, and the ability of a particular microorganism to cause obvious damage and disease in a host can depend greatly on external influences. Primary pathogens12 , which can cause overt disease13 in most healthy people, are usually distinct from the normal flora. They differ from commensal organisms in their abilities to breach barriers and survive in host locations where other microorganisms cannot14. Our normal microbial inhabitants only cause trouble if our immune systems are weakened or if they gain access to a normally sterile part of the body, as when a bowel perforation enables gut flora to enter the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen, causing peritonitis ; occasionally they cause disease if our immune response to them is inappropriately strong15. In contrast, primary pathogens do not require an immunocompromised16 or injured host. Primary pathogens have evolved highly specialized mechanisms for crossing cellular and biochemical barriers and for eliciting specific responses from the host organism that contribute to the pathogen's survival and multiplication17. For some pathogens, these mechanisms are adapted to a unique host species, whereas for others they are sufficiently general that the pathogen can invade, survive, and thrive in a wide variety of hosts.
Some pathogens cause acute epidemic infections and are forced to spread rapidly from one sick or dying host to another; historically important examples include bubonic plague and smallpox. Others cause persistent infections that may last for years in a single individual without necessarily leading to overt disease; examples include Epstein-Barr virus18 (which can cause the severe flu-like illness mononucleosis in some people), the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which can cause the life-threatening lung infection tuberculosis), and the intestinal worm Ascaris. Although each of these pathogens can make some people critically ill, billions of people who are mostly unaware that they are infected carry each of them in an asymptomatic way. It is hard to draw a line between persistent infection and commensalism . Later, we shall continue to acknowledge the diversity of pathogens and infections while focusing on the cell biological principles that are common to many of them. In order to survive and multiply in a host, a successful pathogen must be able to: (1) colonize the host; (2) find a nutritionally compatible niche in the host's body; (3) avoid, subvert, or circumvent the host's innate and adaptive immune responses; (4) replicate, using host resources; and (5) exit and spread to a new host. Under severe selective pressure to induce host responses that help to accomplish these tasks, pathogens have evolved mechanisms that maximally exploit the biology of their host organisms. Many of them are therefore skillful and practical cell biologists, metaphorically speaking19, and we can learn a great deal of cell biology by observing them.
At the same time, our constant exposure to pathogens has strongly influenced human evolution. The development of the exquisitely precise adaptive immune system in vertebrates was an important escalation in the arms race that has always existed between pathogens and their hosts20. In modern times, humans have upped the ante21 by deliberately altering our behavior to limit the ability of pathogens to infect us. Improvements in public health measures, including the construction of working sewer systems and clean water supplies, have contributed to the gradual decline in the frequency of total deaths due to infectious disease over the past several centuries22. Societies that have dedicated resources to improving childhood nutrition have benefited from generally improved health, including greatly reduced death rates from early childhood infections. Medical interventions such as vaccinations, anti-microbial drugs, and routine testing of blood before using it for transfusion, have also substantially reduced the burden of infectious disease for many humans. As we learn more about the mechanisms by which pathogens cause disease (pathogenesis), our brains will continue to serve as an important extension of our immune systems in fighting infectious diseases.

Unit six Text B Hepadnaviruses: Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis D Virus-1-11

????A hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of the liver cells results in expression of viral antigen on the cell surface, followed by immunological cell damage with acute, possibly fulminant, chronic persistent or chronic aggressive hepatitis2. The final stages can be liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. A concurrent or later superinfection3 by a defective, RNA-containing and HBV-dependent hepatitis D virus (HDV, delta agent) normally exacerbates the clinical course. Both viruses are transmitted in blood or body fluids, whereby even a tiny amount of blood may be enough to cause an infection. 
Diagnosis:immunological antigen or antibody assay in patient serum. The antigen or antibody patterns observed provide insights into4 the stage and course of the disease5.
Prevention:active immunization with HBV surface (HBs) antigen; concurrent postexposure6 passive immunization.
??Hepatitis B pathogen. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main representative of the family7 of hepadnaviruses, Hepadnaviridae. The name of the family is an acronym8 of the disease caused by the virus and its genomic type. It causes a sometimes chronic form of liver inflammation (hepatitis) and its genome consists of partially double-stranded9 DNA (hepadnavirus = hepatitis DNA virus). The replication cycle10 of the HBV includes a transient RNA phase. The HBV possess an envelope made up of a cellular double lipid layer in which are integrated the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen, a 25 kDa polypeptide and its precursor stages PreS1 (40 kDa) and PreS2 (33 kDa)11 (Fig. 1). This envelope encloses the actual capsid, which consists of the hepatitis B core (HBc) antigen with 21 kDa and contains the genome together with the DNA polymerase (a reverse transcriptase). The complete, infectious virion, also known as a Dane particle after its discoverer, has a diameter of 42 nm, the inner structure 27 nm12 . The virus replicates in liver cells. The Dane particles and the HBs antigen, but not the HBc antigen, are released into the bloodstream, whereby the HBs antigen is present in two different forms, a filamentous particle approximately 22 × 100 nm and a spherical form with a diameter of about 22 nm. A further viral protein is the HBe antigen, which represents a posttranslational, truncated form of the HBc antigen and is no longer capable of spontaneous capsid formation. It is also released from the hepatic cells into the blood.
Fig.1 The capsid, which consists of Hbc and Hbe antigens, encloses the entire DNA antisense strand, the incomplete sense strand, and the reverse transcriptase (not shown here). The envelope contains the three forms of the Hbs antigen: PreS1 = complete protein, PreS2 = shortened form of PreS1, HBs antigen = HB surface antigen in the proper sense, shortened form of PreS2. 
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Using molecular biological methods refined in recent years, more and more HBV mutants have been found with one or more amino acid exchanges in certain proteins. HBs or PreS mutants are so-called "escape" mutants that can cause a new infection or recidivation despite immune protection by antibodies to HBs13. Similarly, pre-HBVc or HBVc mutants can lead to a reactivation of HBV replication and thus to a chronic hepatitis, since they block formation of the HBe antigen and thus the point of attack for the cellular immune defenses14. These HBc mutants are frequently observed under interferontherapy.
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Hepatitis D pathogen. A certain percentage of HBV-infected persons, which varies geographically, are also infected by a second hepatitis virus discovered at the end of the seventies in Italy, the delta agent or hepatitis D virus (HDV). It was originally thought to be a new HBV antigen. In fact, it is an unclassified RNA virus that codes for the delta antigen. Its capsid consists of HBs antigen,i.e.,HBV-coded material. For this reason, the virus can only replicate in persons infected with HBV (in this case the "helper virus"). 
????The delta agent is 36 nm in size and possesses a very short viral RNA containing 1683 nucleotides. This RNA is circular, has antisense (minus) polarity and is reminiscent in size and structure of the RNA in plant viroids. Its transcription and replication take place in the cell nucleus by means of a cellular polymerase. The resulting RNA sense strand contains,in contrast to viroids, a protein-coding segment comprising about 800 nucleotides, which the cell processes into an mRNA. The HDV codes for two proteins with 27 and 29 kDa (delta antigen). The shorter protein with 195 amino acids, which promotes RNA replication, is produced earlier in the replication cycle. Later, after the stop codon UAG of the mRNA has been transformed into UGG, the longer protein with 214 amino acids is synthesized; it inhibits replication and controls the encapsidation of the HDV RNA in the HBs antigen.
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Pathogenesis and clinical picture15. The incubation period of hepatitis B is four to 12 weeks16, followed by the acute infection phase, icteric, or anicteric. The hepatic cell damage resulting from an HBV infection is not primarily due to cytopathic activity of the virus, but rather to a humoral and cellular immune response directed against the virus-induced membrane antigens (HBs, HBc) on the surface of the infected hepatocytes: 0.5–1% of those infected experience a fulminant, often lethal, hepatitis. In 80–90% of cases the infection runs a benign course with complete recovery and elimination of the HBV from the body. A chronic infection develops in 5–10%. Three forms are differentiated, but mixed forms are possible:
— healthy HBV carriers,
— chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) without viral replication, and finally
— chronic aggressive hepatitis (CAH) with viral replication and a progressive course.
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????A chronic infection can result in development of a carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) or cirrhosis of the liver, with incidence varying widely from one geographic area to another. The delta agent appears to have an unfavorable influence on the clinical course, usually making the disease more aggressive, increasing the number of complications17 and worsening the prognosis.
????Diagnosis. Hepatitis B is diagnosed by identifying the various HBV antigens or the antibodies directed against them. Both antigens and antibodies can be detected in patient blood using a solid phase test (enzyme immunoassay). The individual components manifest in specific patterns. Figure 2 shows the sequence of phases in an uncomplicated hepatitis B infection, upon which the guiding principles in laboratory diagnosis of HBV infections are based18 (Table 1). 
Fig.2 Typical antigen and antibody concentration curves after infection. 

Table 1Laboratory Diagnostics in HBV Infections
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????The hepatitis D virus is diagnosed by detection of delta antigen or possibly antibodies to delta (IgM) in the blood. 
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Epidemiology and prevention. Humans are the sole reservoir of HBV. Transmission is parenteral , either with blood or body fluids containing HBV (sexual intercourse) that come into contact with mucosa, lesions, or microlesions in the skin. In transmission by blood, the tiniest amounts contaminating syringe needles, ear-piercing needles, tattooing instruments, etc. suffice to produce an infection. Hepatitis B infections from blood transfusions have been greatly reduced by thorough screening of blood donors for HBs antigens, despite that patients receiving multiple transfusions or dialysis remain a high-risk group19.
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Another high-risk group includes all healthcare workers with regular blood contact. All blood samples must be considered potentially infectious and handled only with disposable gloves. Addicts who inject drugs with needles are also obviously exposed to a very high level of risk. 
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Since no effective chemotherapy against HBV has been developed to date, the WHO recommends general hepatitis B prophylaxis in the form of active immunization with HBs antigen. In response to a sudden high-level infection risk (accidental inoculation with infectious material), persons whose immune status is uncertain should also be passively immunized with human anti-HBs antiserum—if possible within hours of pathogen contact.It has not yet proved feasible to grow HBV in vitro. The antigen used in vaccinations can be isolated from human blood. Fear of AIDS infections has resulted in emotionally based, unjustifiable rejection of this vaccine. An alternative vaccine is now available based on developments in genetic engineering: the HBs antigen can now be synthesized by a yeast fungus.
Hepatitis B Mutants 
????Prevention: hepatitis B booster vaccines. Periodic booster shots20, especially for persons at high risk, were recommended for some time to maintain sufficient immune protection. However, since all successfully vaccinated persons build up immunity rapidly following renewed contact with the pathogen, this recommendation has been replaced in a number of countries by the following scheme: Following immunization on the classic model (0, 1, and 6 months), the anti-HBs antibody titer is measured within one to three months. Responders (titer 100 IU/l) require no booster. In hyporesponders and nonresponders(titer <100 IU/l), an attempt should be made to reach a titer of 100 IU/l with a maximum of three further vaccinations.

Unit seven Text A Healing & Repair-1&2

????Tissue injuries associated with inflammation are eventually followed by some form of healing. Removal of inflammatory and necrotic cellular debris must precede any such healing. Healing occurs rapidly after transitory injury such as a single minor traumatic episode. Healing is also rapid if the injurious agent is quickly inactivated by the host response, whether inflammatory or immune. With persistent low-grade injury, healing occurs concurrently with ongoing chronic inflammation.
????The ideal result of healing is to restore the tissue to its normal (preinjury) state, a process termed resolution. Removal of debris associated with the inflammatory response is sufficient to restore a tissue to its normal state if injury has been minor (i.e., if minimal parenchymal cell necrosis has occurred). After removal of cellular debris, any necrotic parenchymal cells may be replaced by new parenchymal cells of the same type in a process known as regeneration.
?Resolution is the ideal outcome of healing and occurs in acute inflammatory responses to minor injuries or those with minimal parenchymal cell necrosis. The tissue is in effect restored to the state it was in before injury occurred.
????The fibrinous inflammatory exudate and tissue debris derived from the inactivated injurious agent or necrotic host cells (neutrophils, a few parenchymal cells) are liquefied by lysosomal enzymes liberated by neutrophils and then removed by the lymphatics. Any remaining particulate debris is phagocytosed by macrophages that enter the area during the later stages of the inflammatory response.
REGENERATION 
????Replacement of lost parenchymal cells by division of adjacent surviving parenchymal cells (regeneration) can also restore injured tissue to normal. Whether regeneration occurs depends on (1) the regenerative capacity of involved cells (i.e., their ability to divide), (2) the number of surviving viable cells, and (3) the presence of a connective tissue framework that will provide a base for restoration of normal tissue structure.
????Before regeneration can occur, the necrotic cells must be removed. This involves an acute inflammatory response, liquefaction of cells by neutrophil enzymes, and removal of debris by lymphatics and macrophages.
????The cells of the body can be divided into three groups—labile , stable, and permanent—on the basis of their regenerative capacity (Table 1). 

Table 1 Classification of cells on the basis of their regenerative capacity
Characteristics 
????Labile cells normally divide actively throughout life to replace cells that are being continually lost from the body. Labile cells have a short G0 (resting, or intermitotic) phase. Continued loss of mature cells of a given tissue is a continuous stimulus for resting cells to enter the mitotic cell cycle. Examples of labile cells include basal epithelial stem cells of all epithelial linings and hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. Mature differentiated cells in these particular tissues cannot divide; their numbers are maintained by division of their parent labile cells.
????Injury to a tissue containing labile parenchymal cells is followed by rapid regeneration. For example, surgical removal of the endometrium through curettage or physiologic loss of endometrium during menstruation is followed by complete regeneration of cells from the basal germinative layer within a few days. Similarly, destruction of erythrocytes in peripheral blood (hemolysis) induces hyperplasia of erythroid precursors in bone marrow, with resulting regeneration of destroyed circulating red cells
Healing in Tissues with Labile Cells 
????Regeneration in tissues with labile cells occurs only when enough labile cells have been spared by injury. In the example cited above, overly zealous surgical curettage of the endometrium that removes the entire endometrial lining, including the basal layer, precludes regeneration. Healing then occurs by scar formation, which leads to failure of menstruation and infertility. Likewise, when injury such as that caused by radiation exposure or drugs destroys all of the erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, regeneration cannot occur, and irreversible failure of erythrocyte production follows (aplastic anemia).
Stable Cells (Reversibly Postmitotic or Quiescent Cells) 
????Stable cells typically have a long life span and are therefore characterized by a low rate of division. They remain in the G0 phase for long periods (often years) but retain the capacity to enter the mitotic cell cycle if the need arises. The parenchymal cells of most solid glandular organs (liver, pancreas) and mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells) are examples of stable cells. Unlike labile cells, which are undifferentiated cells that divide frequently and must undergo maturation before becoming functional, stable cells are differentiated functional cells that only revert to a dividing mode at need. Although stable cells have a long resting phase, they can divide rapidly upon demand, e.g., parenchymal cells of the liver swiftly regenerate after necrosis of hepatocytes.
Healing in Tissues with Stable Cells 
????Regeneration in tissues composed of stable cells requires (1) enough viable tissue must remain to provide a source of parenchymal cells for regeneration and (2) there is an intact connective tissue framework. Injuries to the kidney illustrate the need for an adequate connective tissue framework. Selective necrosis of renal tubular cells (acute renal tubular necrosis) with sparing of the renal tubular framework is rapidly followed by regeneration, and the lost cells are replaced by division of surviving tubular cells. On the other hand, when necrosis of both the parenchyma and the connective tissue framework occurs (renal infarct), no regeneration is possible, and healing occurs by scar formation.
Permanent Cells (Irreversibly Postmitotic Cells) 
????Permanent cells have no capacity for mitotic division in postnatal life. Examples of permanent cells include neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system and cardiac muscle cells. 
????Injury to permanent cells is always followed by scar formation. No regeneration is possible. Loss of permanent cells is therefore irreversible and, if extensive, may result in a permanent functional deficit.
????When resolution and regeneration are not possible, necrotic cells are replaced with collagen; this is termed organization, or repair by scar formation. In many instances, a combination of healing processes occurs.
????The mechanism of healing depends on the type of inflammation, the extent of tissue necrosis, the types of cells involved, and the regenerative ability of damaged parenchymal cells. 

Unit seven Text B Classification of Neoplasms-1&2

????Neoplasia (Latin, new growth) is an abnormality of cellular differentiation, maturation, and control of growth. Neoplasms are commonly recognized by the formation of masses of abnormal tissue (tumors). The term tumor can be applied to any swelling—and in that context is one of the cardinal signs of inflammation—but today it is used most commonly to denote suspected neoplasm. Neoplasms are benign or malignant depending on several features, chiefly the ability of malignant neoplasms to spread from the site of origin. Benign neoplasms grow but remain localized. Cancer denotes a malignant neoplasm (the term is thought to derive from the way in which the tumor grips the surrounding tissues with claw-like extensions, much like a crab). 
????Although a neoplasm may not be difficult to recognize, the process of neoplasia is hard to define. The definition of neoplasm proposed in the early 1950s by Rupert Willis, a British pathologist, is probably the best: "A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the surrounding normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli that evoked the change."
APPROACHES TO CLASSIFICATION OF NEOPLASMS 
????Although all neoplasms possess certain characteristics in common—particularly the capacity for uncontrolled continuous growth—they vary enormously in their gross and microscopic features. The clinical presentation, behavior, effects, response to therapy, and etiology are likewise diverse. ????For these reasons, the classification of neoplasms has major implications for prognosis and therapy. Approaches to the classification of neoplasms are summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1 ??Approaches to classification of neoplasms
BIOLOGIC BEHAVIOR OF NEOPLASMS 
Types of Biologic Behavior 
????The biologic behavior of neoplasms constitutes a spectrum(Fig. 1) with two extremes
Fig. 1 ??Biologic behavior of neoplasms. The behavior of neoplasms is shown as a spectrum from benign to highly malignant. There is also an intermediate group of low-grade malignant neoplasms composed of those that have the potential for local recurrence but limited or no metastatic potential.
????At one extreme, benign neoplasms grow slowly and do not invade surrounding tissues or spread to distant sites (i.e., no metastasis). Such neoplasms are rarely life-threatening but may become so because of hormone secretion or critical location, e.g., a benign neoplasm can cause death if it arises in a cranial nerve and compresses the medulla.
Malignant 
????At the other extreme are malignant neoplasms, which grow rapidly, infiltrate and destroy surrounding tissues, and metastasize throughout the body, often with lethal results. 

Malignant
????Between these two extremes is a smaller third group of neoplasms that are locally invasive but have low metastatic potential. Such neoplasms are called locally aggressive neoplasms or low-grade malignant neoplasms. An example is basal cell carcinoma ofthe skin.

Rate of Growth
????Malignant neoplasms generally grow more rapidly than benign ones, but there is no critical rate that distinguishes malignant from benign. Assessment of the growth rate is based upon clinical information (e.g., change in size of the mass in serial examinations). On microscopic examination, the number of mitotic figures and the metabolically active appearance of nuclei (enlarged, dispersed chromatin, large nucleoli) correlate positively with the growth rate of the neoplasm. 
Size 
????The size of a neoplasm usually has no bearing on its biologic behavior. Many benign neoplasms become very large; conversely, highly malignant neoplasms may be lethal by virtue of extensive dissemination even though the original primary tumor is still small. In a few neoplasms, however, size is the deciding factor in distinguishing benign from malignant growths. A carcinoid tumor of the appendix is considered benign unless it is larger than 2 cm, in which case it is regarded as malignant; this distinction is based on the observation that the risk of metastasis increases with increasing size of the primary neoplasm and that appendiceal carcinoid tumors less than 2 cm in diameter do not metastasize. Benign and malignant carcinoid tumors are histologically identical.
Changes in Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) 
????Neoplasms are associated with abnormalities in their DNA content; this abnormality increases with the degree of malignancy. The degree of hyperchromatism (increased staining of the nucleus) provides a crude assessment of DNA content on microscopic examination; malignant cells are hyperchromatic. When measured precisely by flow cytometry, the DNA content of malignant cells correlates well with the degree of malignancy in malignant bladder neoplasms, and astrocytic neoplasms. Cytogenetic studies demonstrating aneuploidy and polyploidy also are indicative of malignancy. Molecular techniques that demonstrate clonal deletions,translocations, or abnormalities of oncogene expression are of increasing value.
Infiltration and Invasion 
????Benign neoplasms are generally noninfiltrative and are surrounded by a capsule of compressed and fibrotic normal tissue. Malignant neoplasms, on the other hand, have infiltrating margins. Many exceptions to this rule exist, and some benign neoplasms—e.g., granular cell tumor, dermatofibroma, and carcinoid tumors—lack a capsule and have an infiltrative margin.

Metastasis
????The occurrence of metastasis (noncontiguous or distant growth of tumor) is absolute evidence of malignancy. The major reason for distinguishing benign from malignant neoplasms is to be able to predict their ability to metastasize before they do so.

CELL OR TISSUE OF ORIGIN (HISTOGENESIS) 
????Neoplasms are classified and named chiefly on the basis of their presumed cell of origin. These cells have different potentials for further development into various cell types (Table 2). 
Table 2 ??Classification of normal cells on the basis of their ability to differentiate into different tissues
Neoplasms of Totipotent Cells 
????The prototype/a> of the totipotent cell—i.e., a cell that is capable of differentiating (maturing) into any cell type in the body—is the zygote, which gives rise to the embryo, and the eventual fetus. In postnatal life, the only totipotent cells in the body are the germ cells. These are most commonly found in the gonads but also occur in the retroperitoneum mediastinum, and pineal region.
????Germ cell neoplasms may remain with minimal differentiation as a mass of malignant primitive germ cells (seminoma and embryonal carcinoma) or may develop into a variety of tissues, including trophoblast (choriocarcinoma), yolk sac(yolk sac carcinoma), or somatic structures (teratoma). Mixtures of different tissues frequently coexist in a single neoplasm.
Teratomas show somatic differentiation and contain elements of all three germ layers: endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. Thus, brain, respiratory and intestinal mucosa, cartilage, bone, skin, teeth, or hair may be seen in the neoplasm. The constituent tissues are not limited to those normally present in the area of origin. One older hypothesis held that teratomas represented a maldeveloped included twin (twin within a twin), but teratomas differ from fetuses in that the various tissues are largely disorganized. Testicular teratomas are diploid or aneuploid, with both X and Y chromosomes; they appear to arise before the first meiotic division and contain the same heterozygous pairs of alleles as are found in the normal host cells. In the ovary, teratomas are usually 46 XX but frequently show homozygous allelic pairs, suggesting an origin after the first meiotic division.
Teratomas are classified as mature (well-differentiated and composed of adult-type tissues) or immature (made up of fetal-type tissues). Immature teratomas are malignant, whereas mature teratomas vary in their biologic potential. Most mature teratomas are benign, e.g., mature teratoma of the ovary (dermoid cyst). Mature testicular teratomas are benign when they occur in childhood but are usually malignant in adult testes. In teratomas, the distinction between benign and malignant incorporates unusual criteria such as maturity of constituent tissues, site of occurrence, and age of the patient.
????Pluripotent cells can mature into several different cell types, and the corresponding neoplasms have the potential for formation of diverse structural elements; neoplasms of the renal anlage cells (nephroblastoma) commonly differentiate into structures resembling renal tubules and less often into rudiments of muscle, cartilage, and bone. These neoplasms are generally called embryomas or blastomas.
?Embryonic pluripotent cells are found only in the fetal period and during the first few years of postnatal life. The corresponding neoplasms usually occur in early childhood and only rarely in adults.
????Blastomas may be completely undifferentiated—i.e., are composed of small, malignant, primitive-appearing, hyperchromatic cells—or may show evidence of differentiation, e.g., the presence of primitive renal tubules in nephroblastoma or of ganglion cells in neuroblastoma. Evidence of differentiation generally signifies less malignant biologic behavior.

Neoplasms of Differentiated Cells
????Differentiated, adult-type cells make up most of the cells in the body in postnatal life. They show a restricted potential for differentiation, as seen when they undergo metaplasia. Most human neoplasms are derived from differentiated cells.
