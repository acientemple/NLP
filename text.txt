Most cells possess cytoskeletal elements that are capable of lengthening or shortening and so enable the cell to change its shape. This capacity is important in a variety of cellular functions, e.g., locomotion,phagocytosis, mitosis and extension of processes. Proteins referred to as molecular motors can effect changes of length much more rapidly than systems that are dependent on polymerization-depolymerization mechanisms (actin,tubulin),by using energy from  the hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate(ATP). Of these ATP-dependent systems, one of the most widespreadis based on the interaction of actin and myosin.
