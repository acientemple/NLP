ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES; THE Rh CONDITION 

An antigen, usually a foreign substance (such as a poison, virus, or bacterium), stimulates 
the production of antibodies. Antibodies are protein substances made by white blood cells 
in response to the presence of foreign antigens. For example, the flu virus (antigen) enters 
the body, causing the production of antibodies in the bloodstream. These antibodies then 
attach to and destroy the antigens (viruses) that produced them. The reaction between an 
antigen and an antibody is an immune response (immun/o means protection). See Figure 
4-7. When you receive a vaccine, you actually are receiving dead or weakened antigens that 
stimulate white blood cells (lymphocytes) to make antibodies. These antibodies remain in 
your blood to protect against those specific antigens when encountered in the future.

PREFIXES 119 


Another example of an antigen-antibody reaction is the Rh condition. A person who is Rh 
positive (Rh+) has a protein coating (antigen) on his or her red blood cells (RBCs). This 
specific antigen factor is something that the person is born with and is normal. People who 
are Rh negative (Rh.) have normal RBCs as well, but their red cells lack the Rh factor 
antigen. 

If an Rh. woman and an Rh+ man conceive an embryo, the embryo may be Rh. or Rh+. A 
dangerous condition arises only when the embryo is Rh+ (because this is different from the 
Rh. mother). During delivery of the first Rh+ baby, some of the baby’s blood cells containing 
Rh+ antigens can escape into the mother’s bloodstream. This sensitizes the mother so that 
she produces a low level of antibodies to the Rh+ antigen. Because this occurs at delivery, 
the first baby is generally not affected and is normal at birth. Sensitization can also occur 
after a miscarriage, abortion, or blood transfusions (with Rh+ blood). 

Difficulties arise with the second Rh+ pregnancy. If this embryo also is Rh+, during 
pregnancy the mother’s acquired antibodies (from the first pregnancy) enter the embryo’s 
bloodstream. These antibodies attack and destroy the embryo’s Rh+ RBCs. The embryo 
attempts to compensate for this loss by making many new but immature RBCs called 
erythroblasts (-blast = immature). The affected infant is born with hemolytic disease of the 
newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis. HDN can occur in the first pregnancy if a 
mother has had an Rh+ blood transfusion. 

One of the clinical signs of HDN is jaundice (yellow skin pigmentation). Jaundice results 
from excessive destruction of RBCs. When RBCs break down (hemolysis), the hemoglobin 
within the cells produces bilirubin (a chemical pigment). High levels of bilirubin in the 
bloodstream (hyperbilirubinemia) cause jaundice. To prevent bilirubin from affecting the 
brain cells of the infant, newborns are treated with exposure to bright lights (phototherapy). 
The light decomposes the bilirubin, which is excreted from the infant’s body. 

Physicians administer Rh immunoglobulin to an Rh. woman within 72 hours after each 
Rh+ delivery, abortion, or miscarriage. The globulin binds to Rh+ cells that escape into the 
mother’s circulation and prevents formation of Rh+ antibodies. This protects future babies 
from developing HDN. Figure 4-8 reviews the Rh antigen-antibody reaction.

FIGURE 4-9 Congenital anomalies. (A), Club feet are a hereditary congenital anomaly. (B), Fetal alcohol 
syndrome (FAS) is a congenital anomaly caused by environmental factors during pregnancy. Note facial 
features of FAS: skin folds in corners of eyes, long, smooth groove between the nose and upper lip, thin upper 
lip, and flat nasal bridge. 

CONGENITAL ANOMALY 

An anomaly is an irregularity in a structure or organ. Examples of congenital anomalies 
(those that an infant is born with) include webbed fingers or toes (syndactyly), heart defects, 
and clubbed feet. See Figure 4-9A. Some congenital anomalies are hereditary (passed to the 
infant through chromosomes from the father or mother, or both), whereas others are 
produced by factors present during pregnancy. For example, when a pregnant woman 
drinks high levels of alcohol during pregnancy, there is a pattern of physical and mental 
defects in her infant at birth. See Figure 4-9B. 

RECOMBINANT DNA 

Recombinant DNA technology is the process of taking a gene (a region of DNA) from one 
organism and inserting it into the DNA of another organism. For example, recombinant 
techniques are used to manufacture insulin outside the body. The gene that codes for 
insulin (i.e., contains the recipe for making insulin) is cut out of a human chromosome 
(using special enzymes) and transferred into a bacterium, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). 
The bacterium then contains the gene for making human insulin and, because it multiplies 
very rapidly, can produce insulin in large quantities. Diabetic patients, unable to make their 
own insulin, can use this synthetic product (see Figure 4-10). Another term you may hear 
related to recombinant DNA is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This is a method of 
producing multiple copies of a single gene, which is an important tool in recombinant DNA 
technology.

SYNDROME 
A syndrome (from the Greek dromos, meaning a course for running) is a group of signs or 
symptoms that appear together to produce a typical clinical picture of a disease or inherited 
abnormality. For example, Reye syndrome is characterized by vomiting, swelling of the 
brain, increased intracranial pressure, hypoglycemia, and dysfunction of the liver. It may 
occur in children after a viral infection that has been treated with aspirin. 
Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder marked by a tall, thin body 
type with long, “spidery” fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), elongated head, and heart, 
blood vessel, and ophthalmic abnormalities (see Figure 4-11).

140 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 


5 
INTRODUCTION 

The digestive system is divided between Chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 5 covers the anatomy, 
physiology, pathology, and basic terminology of the system. Chapter 6 introduces additional 
terminology and review of digestive system terms, plus laboratory tests, clinical procedures, 
and abbreviations. My reason for not combining the chapters is that I did not want to 
overwhelm you with an extraordinarily long chapter so early in your study. In my own 
teaching, I find that my students are grateful for this separation, and especially for the 
breather and review of terminology in Chapter 6. 

My choice to begin with the digestive system is based on a perception that this body 
system (resembling a long conveyor belt with the mouth at the entrance and anus at the 
exit) is one of the more straightforward and easiest to teach and understand. Keep in mind, 
however, that the book is organized so that you may begin study of the body systems with 
any chapter to create the order that best reflects your interests. 

The digestive or gastrointestinal tract begins with the mouth, where food enters, and 
ends with the anus, where solid waste material leaves the body. The four functions of the 
system are ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination. 

First, complex food material taken into the mouth is ingested. Second, it is digested, or 
broken down, mechanically and chemically, as it travels through the gastrointestinal tract. 
Digestive enzymes speed up chemical reactions and aid the breakdown (digestion) of 
complex nutrients. Complex proteins are digested to simpler amino acids; complicated 
sugars are reduced to simple sugars, such as glucose; and large fat or lipid molecules are 
broken down to simpler substances such as fatty acids and triglycerides (three parts fatty 
acids and one part glycerol). Digestion occurs in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. 

Third, via absorption, digested food passes through the lining cells or epithelium of the 
small intestine and into the bloodstream. Nutrients thus travel to all cells of the body. Cells 
then break down nutrients in the presence of oxygen to release energy. Cells also use amino 
acid nutrients to build up large protein molecules needed for growth and development. In 
addition, fat molecules are absorbed into lymphatic vessels from the intestine. 

The fourth function of the digestive system is elimination of the solid waste materials 
that cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream. The large intestine concentrates these solid 
wastes, called feces, and the wastes finally pass out of the body through the anus. 

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 

ORAL CAVITY 

The gastrointestinal tract begins with the oral cavity. Oral means pertaining to the mouth 
(or/o). Label Figure 5-1 as you learn the major parts of the oral cavity. 

The cheeks [1] form the walls of the oval-shaped oral cavity, and the lips [2] surround the 
opening to the cavity. 

The hard palate [3] forms the anterior portion of the roof of the mouth, and the muscular 
soft palate [4] lies posterior to it. Rugae are irregular ridges in the mucous membrane 
covering the anterior portion of the hard palate. The uvula [5], a small soft tissue projection, 
hangs from the soft palate. It aids production of sounds and speech. 

The tongue [6] extends across the floor of the oral cavity, and muscles attach it to the 
lower jawbone. It moves food around during mastication (chewing) and deglutition 
(swallowing). Papillae, small raised areas on the tongue, contain taste buds that are sensitive 
to the chemical nature of foods and allow discrimination of different tastes as food moves 
across the tongue.

FIGURE 5-1 Oral cavity. 

The tonsils [7], masses of lymphatic tissue located in depressions of the mucous 
membranes, lie on both sides of the oropharynx (part of the throat near the mouth). They 
are filters to protect the body from the invasion of microorganisms and produce lymphocytes,

Figure 5-3 shows the inner anatomy of a tooth. Label it as you read the following 
description: 

A tooth consists of a crown [1], which shows above the gum line, and a root [2], which 
lies within the bony tooth socket. The outermost protective layer of the crown, the 
enamel [3], protects the tooth. Enamel is a dense, hard, white substance—the hardest 
substance in the body. Dentin [4], the main substance of the tooth, lies beneath the enamel 
and extends throughout the crown. Dentin is yellow and composed of bony tissue that 
is softer than enamel. The cementum covers, protects, and supports the dentin in the root. 
A periodontal membrane surrounds the cementum and holds the tooth in place in the 
tooth socket. 

The pulp [5] lies underneath the dentin. This soft and delicate tissue fills the center of the 
tooth. Blood vessels, nerve endings, connective tissue, and lymphatic vessels are within the 
pulp canal (also called the root canal). Root canal therapy often is necessary when disease 
or abscess (pus collection) occurs in the pulp canal. A dentist opens the tooth from above 
and cleans the canal of infected tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. The canal is then disinfected 
and filled with material to prevent the entrance of microorganisms that could cause decay. 

Three pairs of salivary glands (Figure 5-4) surround and empty into the oral cavity. These 
exocrine glands produce saliva, which lubricates the mouth. Saliva contains important 
digestive enzymes as well as healing growth factors such as cytokines. Saliva is released 
from a parotid gland [1], submandibular gland [2], and sublingual gland [3] on both sides 
of the mouth. Narrow ducts carry saliva into the oral cavity. The glands produce about 

1.5 liters of saliva daily.

PHARYNX 
Refer to Figure 5-5. The pharynx or throat is a muscular tube, about 5 inches long, lined 
with a mucous membrane. It serves as a passageway both for air traveling from the nose 
(nasal cavity) to the windpipe (trachea) and for food traveling from the oral cavity to 
the esophagus. When swallowing (deglutition) occurs, a cartilaginous flap of tissue, the 
epiglottis, covers the trachea so that food cannot enter and become lodged there. See Figure 
5-5A and B.

FIGURE 5-6 The gastrointestinal tract. 

Figure 5-6 shows the passageway for food as it travels from the esophagus through the 
gastrointestinal tract. Label it as you read the following paragraphs. 

ESOPHAGUS 

The esophagus [1] is a 9- to 10-inch muscular tube extending from the pharynx to the 
stomach. Peristalsis is the involuntary, progressive, rhythmic contraction of muscles in 
the wall of the esophagus (and other gastrointestinal organs) propelling a bolus (mass 
of food) down toward the stomach. The process is like squeezing a marble through a 
rubber tube. 



DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 145 


STOMACH 

Food passes from the esophagus into the stomach [2]. The stomach (Figure 5-7) has three 
main parts: fundus (upper portion), body (middle section), and antrum (lower portion). 
Rings of muscle called sphincters control the openings into and leading out of the stomach. 
They prevent food from regurgitating (flowing backward from the normal direction). The 
lower esophageal sphincter relaxes and contracts to move food from the esophagus into the 
stomach; the pyloric sphincter allows food to leave the stomach when it is ready. Folds in 
the mucous membrane (mucosa) lining the stomach are called rugae. The rugae increase 
surface area for digestion and contain digestive glands that produce the enzyme pepsin (to 
begin digestion of proteins) and hydrochloric acid. 

Besides beginning the digestion of proteins, the stomach prepares food for the small 
intestine, where further digestion and absorption into the bloodstream take place. The 
stomach controls passage of foods into the first part of the small intestine so that it proceeds 
only when it is chemically ready and in small amounts. Food leaves the stomach in 1 to 
4 hours or longer, depending on the amount and type of food eaten. 

SMALL INTESTINE (SMALL BOWEL) 

(Continue labeling Figure 5-6 on page 144.) 

The small intestine (small bowel) extends for 20 feet from the pyloric sphincter to the 
first part of the large intestine. It has three parts. The first section, the duodenum [3], is 
only 1 foot long. It receives food from the stomach as well as bile from the liver [4] and 
gallbladder [5] and pancreatic juice from the pancreas [6]. Enzymes and bile help digest 
food before it passes into the second part of the small intestine, the jejunum [7], about 
8 feet long. The jejunum connects with the third section, the ileum [8], about 11 feet long. 
The ileum attaches to the first part of the large intestine.

Millions of tiny, microscopic projections called villi line the walls of the small intestine. 
The tiny capillaries (microscopic blood vessels) in the villi absorb the digested nutrients 
into the bloodstream and lymph vessels. Figure 5-8 shows several different views of villi in 
the lining of the small intestine. 
LARGE INTESTINE (LARGE BOWEL) 
(Continue labeling Figure 5-6 on page 144.) 
The large intestine extends from the end of the ileum to the anus. It has three main 
components: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum [9] is a pouch on the right 
side that connects to the ileum at the ileocecal valve (sphincter). The appendix [10] hangs 
from the cecum. The appendix has no clear function and can become inflamed and infected 
when clogged or blocked. The colon, about 5 feet long, has four named segments: ascending, 
descending, transverse, and sigmoid. The ascending colon [11] extends from the cecum to 
the undersurface of the liver, where it turns to the left (hepatic flexure) to become the 
transverse colon [12]. The transverse colon passes horizontally to the left toward the spleen 
and then turns downward (splenic flexure) into the descending colon [13]. The sigmoid 
colon [14], shaped like an S (sigmoid means resembling the Greek letter sigma, which 
curves like the letter S), begins at the distal end of the descending colon and leads into the 
rectum [15]. The rectum terminates in the lower opening of the gastrointestinal tract, the 
anus [16]. 
The large intestine receives the fluid waste products of digestion (the material unable 
to pass into the bloodstream) and stores these wastes until they can be released from the 
body. Because the large intestine absorbs most of the water within the waste material, the 
body can expel solid feces (stools). Defecation is the expulsion or passage of feces from 
FIGURE 5-8 Villi in the lining 
of the small intestine. Villi 
increase the surface area for 
absorption of nutrients.


DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 147

the body through the anus. Diarrhea, or passage of watery stools, results from reduced 
water absorption into the bloodstream through the walls of the large intestine. 
LIVER, GALLBLADDER, AND PANCREAS 
Three important additional organs of the digestive system—the liver, gallbladder, and 
pancreas—play crucial roles in the proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. Label 
Figure 5-9 as you study the following: 
The liver [1], located in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen, manufactures a 
thick, orange-black, sometimes greenish, fluid called bile. Bile contains cholesterol (a fatty 
substance), bile acids, and several bile pigments. One of these pigments, bilirubin, is 
produced from the breakdown of hemoglobin during normal red blood cell destruction. 
Bilirubin travels via the bloodstream to the liver, where it is conjugated or converted into a 
water-soluble form. Conjugated bilirubin is then added to bile and enters the intestine 
(duodenum). Bacteria in the colon degrade bilirubin into a variety of pigments that give 
feces a brownish color. Bilirubin and bile leave the body in feces. 
If the bile duct is blocked or the liver is damaged and unable to excrete bilirubin into bile, 
the bilirubin remains in the bloodstream, causing jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia)—yellow 
discoloration of the skin, whites of the eyes, and mucous membranes. Figure 5-10 reviews 
the path of bilirubin from red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) to elimination with bile in 
the feces. 
(Continue labeling Figure 5-9.) 
The liver continuously releases bile, which then travels through the hepatic duct to the 
cystic duct. The cystic duct leads to the gallbladder [2], a pear-shaped sac under the liver, 
which stores and concentrates the bile for later use. After meals, in response to the presence 
of food in the stomach and duodenum, the gallbladder contracts, forcing the bile out the 
cystic duct into the common bile duct [3]. Meanwhile, the pancreas [4] secretes pancreatic 
juices (enzymes) that are released into the pancreatic duct [5], which joins with the 
common bile duct just as it enters the duodenum [6]. The duodenum thus receives a 
mixture of bile and pancreatic juices.

Unconjugated bilirubin (measured in lab tests

bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin (measured as 
“direct bilirubin”) is posthepatic bilirubin. 

Bile has a detergent-like effect on fats in the duodenum. In the process of emulsification, 
bile breaks apart large fat globules, creating more surface area so that enzymes from the 
pancreas can digest the fats. Without bile, most of the fat taken into the body remains 
undigested. 

Besides producing bile, the liver has several other vital and important functions: 

. Maintaining normal blood glucose (sugar) levels. The liver removes excess glucose 
from the bloodstream and stores it as glycogen (starch) in liver cells. When the blood 
sugar level becomes dangerously low, the liver converts stored glycogen back into 
glucose via a process called glycogenolysis. In addition, the liver can convert proteins 
and fats into glucose, when the body needs sugar, by a process called gluconeogenesis. 
. Manufacturing blood proteins, particularly those necessary for blood clotting 
. Releasing bilirubin, a pigment in bile 
. Removing poisons (toxins) from the blood

FIGURE 5-11 The pancreas and its functions. 



DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 149 


The portal vein brings blood to the liver from the intestines. Digested foods pass into the 
portal vein directly after being absorbed into the capillaries of the small intestine, thus 
giving the liver the first chance to use the nutrients. 

The pancreas (Figure 5-11) is both an exocrine and an endocrine organ. As an 
exocrine gland, it produces enzymes to digest starch, such as amylase (amyl/o = starch, 
-ase = enzyme), to digest fat, such as lipase (lip/o = fat), and to digest proteins, such as 
protease (prote/o = protein). These pass into the duodenum through the pancreatic duct. 

As an endocrine gland (secreting into the bloodstream), the pancreas secretes insulin. 
This hormone, needed to help release sugar from the blood, acts as a carrier to bring glucose 
into cells of the body to be used for energy.

PATHOLOGY OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 

This section presents medical terms that describe signs and symptoms (clinical 
indications of illness) and pathologic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Sentences 
following each definition describe the etiology (eti/o = cause) of the illness and treatment. 
When the etiology (cause) is not understood, the condition is idiopathic (idi/o = unknown). 
You can find a list of drugs prescribed to treat gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and 
conditions on pages 894-895 in Chapter 21, Pharmacology. 

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS 
anorexia Lack of appetite. 
Anorexia (-orexia = appetite) often is a sign of malignancy or liver disease. Anorexia 
nervosa is loss of appetite associated with emotional problems such as anger, 
anxiety, and irrational fear of weight gain. It is an eating disorder and is discussed 
along with a similar eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, in Chapter 22. 
ascites Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. 
This condition occurs when fluid passes from the bloodstream and collects in 
the peritoneal cavity. It can be a sign of neoplasm or inflammatory disorders 
in the abdomen, venous hypertension (high blood pressure) caused by liver 
disease (cirrhosis), or heart failure (Figure 5-18). Treatment for ascites includes 
administration of diuretic drugs and paracentesis to remove abdominal fluid. 
borborygmus (plural: 
borborygmi) 
Rumbling or gurgling noise produced by the movement of gas, fluid, or 
both in the gastrointestinal tract. 
A sign of hyperactive intestinal peristalsis, borborygmi (bowel sounds) often are 
present in cases of gastroenteritis and diarrhea. 
constipation Difficulty in passing stools (feces). 
When peristalsis is slow, stools are dry and hard. A diet of fruit, vegetables, and 
water is helpful. Laxatives and cathartics are medications to promote movement of 
stools. 

5 
FIGURE 5-18 Ascites in a male patient. The photograph was taken 
after paracentesis (puncture to remove fluid from the abdomen) was 
performed. Notice the gynecomastia (condition of female-type 
breasts) in this patient due to an excess of estrogen, which can 
accompany cirrhosis, especially in persons with alcoholism. 


Signs and Symptoms 


A sign is an objective finding—such as an increase in body temperature, a rash, or a sound heard on listening to the chest— 
indicating the presence of disease as perceived by an examiner. However, a symptom is a subjective sensation or 
change in health—such as itching, pain, fatigue, or nausea—as experienced by the patient. Clearly, the same feature may 
be noticed by both doctor and patient, which makes it at once both a sign and a symptom! 



160 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 


diarrhea Frequent passage of loose, watery stools. 
Abrupt onset of diarrhea immediately after eating suggests acute infection or toxin 
in the gastrointestinal tract. Untreated, severe diarrhea may lead to dehydration. 
Antidiarrheal drugs are helpful. 
dysphagia Difficulty in swallowing. 
This sensation feels like a “lump in the throat” when a swallowed bolus fails 
to progress, either because of a physical obstruction (obstructive dysphagia) or 
because of a motor disorder in which esophageal peristalsis is not coordinated 
(motor dysphagia). 
eructation Gas expelled from the stomach through the mouth. 
Eructation produces a characteristic sound and also is called belching. 
flatus Gas expelled through the anus. 
Flatulence is the presence of excessive gas in the stomach and the intestines. 
hematochezia Passage of fresh, bright red blood from the rectum. 
The cause of hematochezia usually is bleeding due to colitis or from ulcers or 
polyps in the colon or rectum. 
jaundice (icterus) Yellow-orange coloration of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by 
high levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). See Figure 
5-19. 
Jaundice can occur when (1) excessive destruction of erythrocytes, as in hemolysis, 
causes excess bilirubin in the blood; (2) malfunction of liver cells (hepatocytes) 
due to liver disease prevents the liver from excreting bilirubin with bile; or 
(3) obstruction of bile flow, such as from choledocholithiasis or tumor, prevents 
bilirubin in bile from being excreted into the duodenum. 

5 
FIGURE 5-19 Jaundice due to liver disease. 



DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 161 


melena Black, tarry stools; feces containing digested blood. 
This clinical sign usually reflects a condition in which blood has had time to be 
digested (acted on by intestinal juices) and results from bleeding in the upper 
gastrointestinal tract (duodenal ulcer). A positive result on stool guaiac testing 
(see page 193) indicates blood in the stool. 
nausea Unpleasant sensation in the stomach associated with a tendency to 
vomit. 
Common causes are sea and motion sickness and early pregnancy. Nausea and 
vomiting may be symptomatic of a perforation (hole in the wall) of an abdominal 
organ; obstruction of a bile duct, stomach, or intestine; or exposure to toxins 
(poisons). 
steatorrhea Fat in the feces; frothy, foul-smelling fecal matter. 
Improper digestion or absorption of fat can cause fat to remain in the intestine. 
This may occur with disease of the pancreas (pancreatitis) when pancreatic 
enzymes are not excreted. It also is a sign of intestinal disease that involves 
malabsorption of fat. 

PATHOLOGIC CONDITIONS 

ORAL CAVITY AND TEETH 

aphthous stomatitis 
Inflammation of the mouth with small, painful ulcers. 
The ulcers associated with this condition are commonly called canker (K.NK-.r) 
sores; the cause is unknown (Figure 5-20B). 

dental caries 
Tooth decay. 
Dental plaque results from the accumulation of foods, proteins from saliva, and 
necrotic debris on the tooth enamel. Bacteria grow in the plaque and cause 
production of acid that dissolves the tooth enamel, resulting in a cavity (area of 
decay) (Figure 5-20C). If the bacterial infection reaches the pulp of the tooth, root 
canal therapy may be necessary.

162 DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 


herpetic stomatitis Inflammation of the mouth caused by infection with the herpesvirus. 
Painful fluid-filled blisters on the lips, palate, gums, and tongue, commonly called 
fever blisters or cold sores (Figure 5-20D). It is caused by herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (HSV1). Treatment is with medication to relieve symptoms. Herpes genitalis 
(due to HSV2) occurs on the reproductive organs. Both conditions are highly 
contagious. 
oral leukoplakia White plaques or patches on the mucosa of the mouth. 
This precancerous lesion (Figure 5-20E) can result from chronic tobacco use (pipe 
smoking or chewing tobacco). Malignant potential is assessed by microscopic 
study of biopsied tissue. 
periodontal disease Inflammation and degeneration of gums, teeth, and surrounding bone. 
Gingivitis (Figure 5-20F) occurs as a result of accumulation of dental plaque 
and dental calculus or tartar (a yellow-brown calcified deposit on teeth). In 
gingivectomy, a periodontist uses a metal instrument to scrape away plaque and 
tartar from teeth; any pockets of pus (pyorrhea) are then drained and removed to 
allow new tissue to form. Localized infections are treated with systemic antibiotics. 

UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT 

achalasia Failure of the lower esophagus sphincter (LES) muscle to relax. 

Achalasia (-chalasia = relaxation) results from the loss of peristalsis so that food 
cannot pass easily through the esophagus. Both failure of the LES to relax and 
the loss of peristalsis cause dilatation (widening) of the esophagus above the 
constriction. Physicians recommend a bland diet low in bulk and mechanical 
stretching of the LES to relieve symptoms. 

esophageal cancer Malignant tumor of the esophagus. 

The most common symptom of esophageal cancer is difficulty swallowing 
(dysphagia). Smoking and chronic alcohol use are major risk factors. Long-term 
irritation of the esophagus caused by gastric reflux is a premalignant condition 
called Barrett esophagus. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are 
treatment options. 

esophageal varices Swollen, varicose veins at the lower end of the esophagus. 

Liver disease (such as cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis) causes increased pressure in 
veins near and around the liver (portal hypertension). This leads to enlarged, 
tortuous esophageal veins with danger of hemorrhage (bleeding). Treatment 
includes drug therapy to lower portal hypertension and banding or tying off the 
swollen esophageal veins (Figure 5-21A and B). 

gastric cancer Malignant tumor of the stomach. 

Chronic gastritis associated with bacterial infection is a major risk factor for gastric 
carcinoma. Gastric endoscopy and biopsy diagnose the condition. Cure depends on 
early detection and surgical removal of the cancerous tissue. 

gastroesophageal reflux Solids and fluids return to the mouth from the stomach. 
disease (GERD) Heartburn is the burning sensation caused by regurgitation of hydrochloric acid 

from the stomach to the esophagus. Chronic exposure of esophageal mucosa to 

gastric acid and pepsin (an enzyme that digests protein) leads to reflux esophagitis. 

Drug treatment for GERD includes antacid (acid-suppressive) agents and 

medication to increase the tone of the LES.

hernia 
Protrusion of an organ or part through the tissues and muscles 
normally containing it. 
A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach protrudes upward 
through the diaphragm (Figure 5-22A). This condition can lead to GERD. An 
inguinal hernia occurs when a small loop of bowel protrudes through a weak lower 
abdominal wall tissue (fascia) surrounding muscles (Figure 5-22B). Surgical repair 
of inguinal hernias is known as herniorrhaphy (-rrhaphy means suture). 

peptic ulcer 
Open sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum. 

A bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), is responsible for peptic ulcer disease. 
The combination of bacteria, hyperacidity, and gastric juice damages epithelial 
linings. Drug treatment includes antibiotics, antacids, and agents to protect the 
lining of the stomach and intestine.

LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (SMALL AND LARGE INTESTINES) 
anal fistula Abnormal tube-like passageway near the anus. 
The fistula often results from a break or fissure in the wall of the anus or rectum, 
or from an abscess (infected area) there (Figure 5-23A). 
colonic polyps Polyps (benign growths) protrude from the mucous membrane of the 
colon. 
Figure 5-23A illustrates two types of polyps: pedunculated (attached to the 
membrane by a stalk) and sessile (sitting directly on the mucous membrane). 
Figure 5-23B shows multiple polyps of the colon. Many polyps are premalignant 
(adenomatous polyps) and are often removed (polypectomy) for biopsy. 
colorectal cancer Adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, or both. 
Colorectal cancer (Figure 5-24) can arise from polyps in the colon or rectal region. 
Diagnosis is determined by detecting melena (blood in stool) and by colonoscopy. 
Prognosis depends on the stage (extent of spread) of the tumor, including size, 
depth of invasion, and involvement of lymph nodes. Surgical treatment may 
require excision of a major section of colon with rejoining of the cut ends 
(anastomosis). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are administered as needed. 
Crohn disease (“Crohn’s”) Chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. 
Crohn’s can occur anywhere from mouth to anus but most commonly in the ileum 
(ileitis) and colon. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, 
fever, anorexia, weakness, and weight loss. Both Crohn disease and ulcerative 
colitis are forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Treatment is with drugs 
that control inflammation and other symptoms or by surgical removal of diseased 
portions of the intestine, with anastomosis of remaining parts. Read the In Person 
story about Crohn’s on page 170.

diverticulosis Abnormal outpouchings (diverticula) in the intestinal wall of the colon. 
See Figure 5-25A. 
Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis. When fecal matter becomes 
trapped in diverticula, diverticulitis can occur. Pain and rectal bleeding are 
symptoms. Figure 5-25B and C show diverticulitis in a section through the 
sigmoid colon. Initial treatment for an attack of diverticulitis includes a liquid diet 
and oral antibiotics. In severe cases, patients may need hospitalization, IV 
antibiotics, and surgery to remove the affected area of the colon with anastomosis 
of the cut ends. 
dysentery Painful, inflamed intestines commonly caused by bacterial infection. 
Often occurring in the colon, dysentery results from ingestion of food or water 
containing bacteria (salmonellae or shigellae), amebae (one-celled organisms), or 
viruses. Symptoms are bloody stools and abdominal pain. 
hemorrhoids Swollen, twisted, varicose veins in the rectal region. 
Varicose veins can be internal (within the rectum) or external (outside the anal 
sphincter). Pregnancy and chronic constipation, which put pressure on anal veins, 
often cause hemorrhoids.

intussusception 
Telescoping of the intestines. 

In this condition, one segment of the bowel collapses into the opening of another 
segment (Figure 5-26). It often occurs in children and at the ileocecal region. 
Intestinal obstruction with pain and vomiting can occur. A barium enema can 
diagnose and may successfully reduce the intussusception. Otherwise, surgery 
to remove the affected segment of bowel (followed by anastomosis) may be 
necessary. 

irritable bowel syndrome Group of GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, 
(IBS) constipation), but without abnormalities in the intestines. 


IBS may be associated with stress or occur after infection. Treatment is symptomatic, 
with a diet high in bran and fiber to soften stools and establish regular bowel 
habits. Other names for IBS are irritable colon and spastic colon. IBS is a type of 
functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). These are disorders of how the GI 
tract functions, but without structural or biochemical abnormalities. 

ulcerative colitis 
Chronic inflammation of the colon with presence of ulcers. 
This idiopathic, chronic, recurrent diarrheal disease (an inflammatory bowel 
disease) presents with rectal bleeding and pain. Often beginning in the colon, the 
inflammation spreads proximally, involving the entire colon. Drug treatment and 
careful attention to diet are recommended. Resection of diseased bowel with 
ileostomy may be necessary. In some cases it is cured by total colectomy. Patients 
with ulcerative colitis have a higher risk of colon cancer. 


Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 

While IBS is a condition with no structural abnormalities of the intestines, IBD (Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis) involves 
structural abnormalities. 



DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 167 
5 
volvulus Twisting of the intestine on itself. 
Volvulus causes intestinal obstruction. Severe pain, nausea and vomiting, and 
absence of bowel sounds are clinical features. Surgical correction is necessary to 
prevent necrosis of the affected segment of the bowel (see Figure 5-26). 
LIVER, GALLBLADDER, AND PANCREAS 
cholelithiasis Gallstones in the gallbladder. 
Calculi (stones) prevent bile from leaving the gallbladder and bile ducts (Figure 
5-27). Many patients remain asymptomatic and do not require treatment; 
symptoms related to gallbladder stones are either biliary colic (pain from blocked 
ducts) or cholecystitis (inflammation and infection of the gallbladder), both 
of which require treatment. Currently, laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery 
(laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is performed to remove the gallbladder and stones 
(Figure 5-28A and B). 
What’s “in” Gallstones? 
Gallstones are composed of cholesterol, bilirubin (pigment in bile) and calcium salts. They can vary in size and shape from as 
small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball!

cirrhosis Chronic degenerative disease of the liver. 
Cirrhosis is commonly the result of chronic alcoholism, viral hepatitis, or other 
causes. Lobes of the liver become scarred with fibrous tissue, hepatic cells 
degenerate, and the liver is infiltrated with fat. Cirrh/o means yellow-orange, 
which describes the liver’s color caused by fat accumulation. Figure 5-29 shows a 
normal liver and a liver with alcoholic cirrhosis.

pancreatic cancer Malignant tumor of the pancreas. 

It often occurs in the head of the pancreas (closer to the duodenum), where it can 
block ducts. Although the cause is unknown, pancreatic cancer is more common 
in smokers and people with diabetes and chronic pancreatitis. Symptoms and 
signs are abdominal pain, fatigue, jaundice, anorexia, and weight loss. The standard 
surgical treatment is a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). 


pancreatitis Inflammation of the pancreas. 

Digestive enzymes attack pancreatic tissue and damage the gland. Other etiologic 
factors include chronic alcoholism, drug toxicity, gallstone obstruction of the 
common bile duct, and viral infections. Treatment includes medications to relieve 
epigastric pain, intravenous fluids, bowel rest, and subtotal pancreatectomy if 
necessary. 

viral hepatitis Inflammation of the liver caused by a virus. 
Hepatitis A is viral hepatitis caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is a benign 
disorder spread by contaminated food or water and characterized by slow onset of 
symptoms. Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is transmitted 
by blood transfusion, sexual contact, or the use of contaminated needles or 
instruments. Severe infection can cause destruction of liver cells, cirrhosis, or 
death. A vaccine that provides immunity is available and recommended for persons 
at risk for exposure. Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 
is transmitted by blood transfusions or needle inoculation (such as among 
intravenous drug users sharing needles). The acute illness may progress to chronic 
hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
In all types, liver enzyme levels may be elevated, indicating damage to liver cells. 
Signs and symptoms include malaise, anorexia, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and 
abdominal pain. 


Whipple Procedure for Pancreatic Cancer

This surgery consists of: 

. removal of the distal half of the stomach (antrectomy) 
. removal of gallbladder and common bile duct (cholecystectomy and choledochectomy) 
. removal of part of the pancreas and duodenum, (pancreatoduodenectomy) 
. reconstruction consists of pancreatojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy

IN PERSON 


This first-person narrative was written by a woman living with Crohn disease 
(“Crohn’s”). 

When a friend told me she was felled by the flu yesterday, I was jealous. To 
someone with a chronic illness, like me, having something acute always seems 
luxurious. Lie in bed, read glossy magazines, take over-the-counter meds, sleep 
it off, and in a matter of days you’re okay. I have Crohn disease, a chronic 
inflammation of the small intestine, which is characterized by flare-ups and remission. During flare-ups, I’ve 
experienced fever, diarrhea, vomiting, pain, and intestinal obstruction. Even in remission I am never “okay.” 

Right now I have been in remission two years after a third surgery to remove yet another portion of my 
small bowel. This time internal bleeding, a rather rare symptom of Crohn’s, necessitated the surgery. I was 
enduring weekly iron infusions, which turned into bimonthly blood transfusions, as my hemoglobin 
plummeted to 6 (12 is normal). It was no way to live. After the surgery, the bleeding stopped, but I had bouts 
of urgent, watery diarrhea for a year. That was no way to live either, and unfortunately, as wonderful as my 
doctor is, I’ve found that few GIs want to address after-effects of small bowel surgery. After visiting several 
doctors and by trial-and-error, I finally got these symptoms under control with codeine, Lomotil, and 
Metamucil, but I will never be able to absorb vitamin B12, so I must inject it monthly for the rest of my life. In 
addition to taking medicine to cope with having less and less small bowel, I take medicine in the hopes of 
preventing the next flare-up. Every few weeks, I inject myself with a biologic medicine, Humira, but I must 
eventually be weaned off this drug because it has possible long-term side effects, the scariest of which is 
lymphoma. At 52 and with two school-age children, however, I have learned to think of valuing my present 
quality of life the most, over possible unknown dangers lurking in the future. 

I do often think about the past. What would my life be like if our family doctor hadn’t told my parents that 
my constant episodes of diarrhea—which occurred since I was a child—were caused by “nerves?” By the time 
I was 21, my weight had dropped below 100 pounds, and I was twisted in pain after every meal. My dad 
arranged for me to visit his own doctor, who gave me a small bowel series that showed I had Crohn’s and that 
a portion of my small intestine was “as narrow as a pencil.” By then it was too late for even prednisone (then 
the drug of choice despite side effects ranging from puffy face to psychosis) to open up the inflamed passage, 
and I had my first surgery just months after I was diagnosed. Thinking of those times—as well as all the other 
flare-up times—makes me flinch. While you can never relive pain, you can remember what it felt like. In my 
case, it was as if a large metal bike lock chain was being forced through my tender gut. 

Before that first surgery, I was just out of college and longing to make my mark on the world, but I spent 
most of my evenings curled up in my small bedroom, listening to the soothing strains of “Make Believe 
Ballroom Hour” on the radio. Or, because vomiting and diarrhea usually accompanied the pain, I lay with my 
back pressed against the cold tiles of the bathroom floor. Later on, as a mom with two young children, I would 
lie on the couch watching life swirl around me, feeling guilty that I could not take part. 

There was a silver lining to those flare-ups, and that is the tender affection of those around me: husband, 
family, and friends. When you have Crohn’s, no one knows you have it until things get unbearable. It’s not the 
kind of illness you discuss, but when you have pain and fever, you can kind of approximate those times of being 
felled by the flu. Yet you know that it will take more than a dose of Nyquil or a night’s sleep to get “better.” You 
know you’ll face another course of medications—often untried ones—or that you will likely end up in the 
hospital undergoing yet another surgery.

INTRODUCTION 

This chapter gives you practice in word building, while not introducing a large number of 
new terms. It uses many familiar terms from Chapter 5, which should give you a breather 
after your hard work. 

Study the suffixes below and complete the meanings of the terms. Checking the 

meanings of the terms with a dictionary may prove helpful and add another dimension to 

your understanding. 

The information included under Laboratory Tests and Clinical Procedures and in the 

Abbreviations section relates to the gastrointestinal system and will be useful for work in 

clinical or laboratory medical settings. 

The Practical Applications section gives you examples of medical language in context. 

Congratulate yourself as you decipher medical sentences, operative reports, and case 

studies.

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

Concentrate on learning the meanings in bold opposite the laboratory test or procedure. Additional information 
is provided to increase your understanding of terms. 

LABORATORY TESTS 
amylase and lipase tests Tests for the levels of amylase and lipase enzymes in the blood. 
Increased levels are associated with pancreatitis. 
liver function tests (LFTs) Tests for the presence of enzymes and bilirubin in blood. 
LFTs are performed on blood serum (clear fluid that remains after blood has 
clotted). Examples of LFTs are tests for ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST 
(aspartate transaminase). ALT and AST are enzymes present in many tissues. 
Levels are elevated in the serum of patients with liver disease. High ALT and AST 
levels indicate damage to liver cells (as in hepatitis). 
Alkaline phosphatase (alk phos) is another enzyme that may be elevated in 
patients with liver, bone, and other diseases. 
Serum bilirubin levels are elevated in patients with liver disease and jaundice. 
A direct bilirubin test measures conjugated bilirubin. High levels indicate liver 
disease or biliary obstruction. An indirect bilirubin test measures unconjugated 
bilirubin. Increased levels mean excessive hemolysis, as may occur in a newborn. 
stool culture Test for microorganisms present in feces. 
Feces are placed in a growth medium and examined microscopically. See Figure 
6-2A. 
stool guaiac test or 
Hemoccult test 
Test to detect occult (hidden) blood in feces. 
This is an important screening test for colon cancer. Guaiac (GWIˉ -a.k) is a 
chemical from the wood of trees. When added to a stool sample, it reacts with any 
blood present in the feces. See Figure 6-2B.

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

X-Ray Tests 

X-ray imaging is used in many ways to detect pathologic conditions. In dental practice, x-ray images are 
commonly used to locate cavities (caries). Many of the x-ray tests listed here use a contrast medium (substance 
that x-rays cannot penetrate) to visualize a specific area of the digestive system. The contrast, because of its 
increased density relative to body tissue, allows organs and parts to be distinguished from one another on the 

film or screen. 
lower gastrointestinal series 
(barium enema) 
X-ray images of the colon and rectum obtained after injection of barium 
into the rectum. 
Radiologists inject barium (a contrast medium) by enema into the rectum. Figure 
6-3A shows a barium enema study of a colon with diverticulosis. 
upper gastrointestinal series X-ray images of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine obtained 
after administering barium by mouth. 
Often performed immediately after an upper gastrointestinal series, a small bowel 
follow-through study shows sequential x-ray pictures of the small intestine as 
barium passes through (Figure 6-3B). A barium swallow is a study of the 
esophagus. 
cholangiography X-ray examination of the biliary system performed after injection of 
contrast into the bile ducts. 
In percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, the contrast medium is injected 
using a needle placed through the abdominal wall into the liver. In endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Figure 6-4A), contrast medium 
is administered through an oral catheter (tube) and then passes through the 
esophagus, stomach, and duodenum and into bile ducts. This procedure helps 
diagnose problems involving the bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreas.

arrowheads point to the diverticula throughout the colon. Most patients with diverticula are asymptomatic, 
but complications (diverticulitis, perforated diverticulum, obstruction, or hemorrhage) may occur. B, An 
x-ray image of a small-bowel follow-through study demonstrating the normal appearance of the jejunum (J) 
in the upper left abdomen and of the ileum (I) in the right lower abdomen. Notice the contrast material

the contrast-opacified gallbladder and duct. This patient was treated with open (performed via laparotomy) cholecystectomy and 
choledocholithotomy. B, Computed tomography scan with contrast showing large “porcelain stone” in the gallbladder. The patient 
was asymptomatic, but a therapeutic option with this type of stone is removal of the gallbladder (using laparoscopy) to prevent any 
future problems (cholecystitis or carcinoma of the gallbladder). (B, Courtesy Radiology Department, Massachusetts General 

Hospital, Boston.) 
computed tomography (CT) A series of x-ray images are taken in multiple views (especially cross 
section). 
A CT scan uses a circular array of x-ray beams to produce the cross-sectional 
image based on differences in tissue densities. Use of contrast material allows 
visualization of organs and blood vessels and highlights differences in blood flow 
between normal and diseased tissues (Figure 6-4B and Figures 6-5A and B). 
Tomography (tom/o means cutting) produces a series of x-ray pictures showing 
multiple views of an organ. An earlier name for a CT scan is “CAT scan” 
(computerized axial tomography scan).

injected intravenously, making blood vessels appear bright. The liver (L) and spleen (S) are the same density on this CT image. 
B, Fatty liver. The radiodensity of the liver tissue is reduced because of the large volume of fat contained in the tissue, making it 
appear darker than normal. Excess fat can lead to inflammation of the liver and cirrhosis. 



196 ADDITIONAL SUFFIXES AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEM TERMINOLOGY 

ULTRASOUND EXAMINATIONS 

abdominal ultrasonography 
Sound waves beamed into the abdomen produce an image of abdominal 
viscera. 

Ultrasonography is especially useful for examination of fluid-filled structures such 
as the gallbladder. 

endoscopic ultrasonography Use of an endoscope combined with ultrasound to examine the organs 
(EUS) of the gastrointestinal tract. 

An endoscope is inserted through the mouth or rectum, and ultrasound images 
are obtained. This test is often used in assessing pancreatic cancer. 

MAGNETIC RESONANCE 

magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic waves produce images of organs and tissues in all three 
(MRI) planes of the body. 

This technique does not use x-rays. It detects subtle differences in tissue 
composition, water content, and blood vessel density, and can show sites of 
trauma, infection, or cancer. See Figure 6-6, which shows an MRI study of a 
patient with rectosigmoid carcinoma and polyps in the rectum. CT scanning 
would not have shown these lesions as clearly.

NUCLEAR MEDICINE TEST 


HIDA scan Radioactive imaging procedure that tracks the production and flow of 
bile from the liver and gallbladder to the intestine. 
HIDA stands for hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid. Cholescintigraphy is another 
name for this test, which determines if the gallbladder is functioning properly. 
OTHER PROCEDURES 
gastric bypass or bariatric 
surgery 
Reducing the size of the stomach and diverting food to the jejunum 
(gastrojejunostomy). 
This is bariatric (bar/o = weight; iatr/o = treatment) surgery for severe obesity. The 
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure reduces the size of the stomach to a volume 
of 2 tablespoons and bypasses much of the small intestine (Figure 6-7). The name 
Roux-en-Y comes from the surgeon who first described it (César Roux) and the 
anastomosis of the duodenum and jejunum, which looks like the letter Y.

FIGURE 6-9 Colonoscopy with polypectomy. Before the procedure, the patient ingests agents to clean 
the bowel of feces. The patient is sedated and the gastroenterologist advances the instrument in retrograde 
fashion, guided by images from a video camera on the tip of the colonoscope. When a polyp is located, a wire 
snare is passed through the endoscope and looped around the stalk. After the loop is gently tightened, an 
electrical current is applied to cut through the stalk. The polyp is removed for microscopic tissue examination 
(biopsy). 
gastrointestinal endoscopy Visual examination of the gastrointestinal tract using an endoscope. 
A physician places a flexible fiberoptic tube through the mouth or the anus to view 
parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Examples are esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
(EGD) (Figure 6-8), colonoscopy (Figures 6-9 and 6-10), sigmoidoscopy, 
proctoscopy, and anoscopy. 
Virtual colonoscopy (CT colonography) combines CT scanning and computer 
technology to enable physicians to examine the entire length of the colon by x-ray 
imaging in just minutes. Because this is only a screening procedure, patients with 
abnormal findings require conventional colonoscopy afterward.

FIGURE 6-10 Colonoscopy case report. A 60-year-old man 
with a history of multiple and prominent colon adenomas 
(with some areas of high-grade dysplasia) underwent 
colonoscopy. The endoscope was passed through the anus 
and advanced to the cecum. Two pedunculated polyps 
(arrows) were found at the hepatic flexure. Polypectomy was 
performed using a hot snare. Resection and retrieval were 
complete. 


laparoscopy Visual (endoscopic) examination of the abdomen with a laparoscope 
inserted through small incisions in the abdomen. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see Figure 5-28, page 168) and laparoscopic 
appendectomy are performed by gastrointestinal and general surgeons. See the 
In Person story of a woman who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see 
page 201). 
liver biopsy Removal of liver tissue for microscopic examination. 
A physician inserts a needle through the skin to remove a small piece of tissue for 
microscopic examination. The average sample is less than 1 inch long. The 
procedure helps doctors diagnose cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and tumors of the 
liver. 
nasogastric intubation Insertion of a tube through the nose into the stomach. 
Physicians use a nasogastric (NG) tube to remove fluid postoperatively and to 
obtain gastric or intestinal contents for analysis (Figure 6-11). 
paracentesis 
(abdominocentesis) 
Surgical puncture to remove fluid from the abdomen. 
This procedure is necessary to drain fluid (accumulated in ascites) from the 
peritoneal (abdominal) cavity.

CASE REPORT: PANCREATIC CANCER AND WHIPPLE PROCEDURE 

A 62-year-old man came to the ED [emergency department] with complaints of fatigue, weight loss, 
jaundice, and anorexia. Diagnostic studies including abdominal CT with contrast, ERCP, and EUS were 
performed. The CT scan showed a 4-cm mass at the head of the pancreas, and ERCP revealed evidence of 
bile duct obstruction; a stent was placed to open the duct. Examination of a tissue biopsy specimen 
obtained under US guidance confirmed a localized adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. 

Additional studies showed no evidence of hepatic or other metastases. Surgical treatment with a 
Whipple procedure was recommended. This procedure was performed and included 
pancreatoduodenectomy, choledochojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Lymph node removal and 
cholecystectomy were part of the operative procedure. During surgery, it was determined that the tumor 
was confined to the head of the pancreas. Despite removal of the tumor, the chance of recurrence is 
high, with a cure rate of only about 20%.

IN PERSON 
This first-person narrative describes the symptoms and treatment of a 42-yearold 
woman with gallbladder stones. 

Everyone enjoys a little dessert after dinner, but when the ice cream or a creamy 
tart leads to pain, most would avoid it. I loved sweets, and despite the revenge 
they took on my waistline, I still would not pass up an ice cream cone—until my 
gallbladder decided it had had enough. After several late nights spent doubled 
over in pain, I tried to steer clear of fatty foods but could not resist the temptation of frozen yogurt. 

With one hand, I pushed my cart through the supermarket; with the other hand, I fed myself some delicious 
low-fat (not non-fat) frozen yogurt. I never dreamed that the attendant at the quick service window actually 
gave me soft-serve ice cream. Within 10 minutes of eating the questionable yogurt, I broke out into a sweat; a 
wave of nausea took me, and a knifelike pain stabbed me in my right upper quadrant. It hurt even more when 
I pressed my hand on the area in an attempt to brace the pain. 

Several months earlier, after a similar painful episode, I had undergone an ultrasound of my gallbladder, and 
the surgeon then recommended cholecystectomy. The U/S showed multiple stones in my gallbladder. Most of 
the stones were just the right size to lodge in the common bile duct and cause blockage of the outflow of bile 
that occurs after a fatty meal. When I heard the ultrasound results, I swore off all fatty foods. 

I just did not imagine that ice cream masquarading as “low-fat yogurt”would be the straw that broke the 
camel’s back! Soon enough, I abandoned my shopping cart and apologized to the manager of the store for 
vomiting all over aisle 4. The unrelenting pain did not cease when I vomited—it only intensified. I have no 
idea how I made it home and into bed, but my husband found me several hours later in a deep sweat. I 
managed to call my surgeon and arrange for “semi-emergent” surgery the next morning. 

Dr. Fernandez and his team performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and relayed to me as I came out of 
anesthesia that I no longer had a “bag of marbles” for a gallbladder. I had a gassy, distended feeling in my 
abdomen over the two weeks after surgery (carbon dioxide gas was injected into the abdomen before surgery 
to allow space between abdominal organs). I felt “tight as a drum” for the first few days and the day by day it 
went away. My four tiny incisions healed just fine, and in about 2 weeks I was feeling back to “normal.” Now I 
can eat ice cream to my heart’s content, only suffering the padding on my waistline, not the stabbing pain just 
above. Without missing a beat, my liver now delivers the bile into my small intestine right after I eat a fatty 
meal. The bile emulsifies (breaks down) the fat. I just don’t have a storage bag to hold bile in reserve. 

I’ve had an appendectomy, my wisdom teeth removed, and now I gave up my gallbladder! How many more 
“useless” body parts are there to go?

216 URINARY SYSTEM 


INTRODUCTION 

When foods containing proteins are used by cells in the body, nitrogenous waste products 
(urea, creatinine, and uric acid) are released into the bloodstream. The urinary system 
removes these nitrogenous wastes from the blood so that they do not accumulate and 
become harmful. As blood passes through the kidneys, the kidneys filter nitrogenous wastes 
to form urine (composed of water, salts, and acids). Urine leaves the body through the 
ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Every day, the kidneys process about 200 quarts of 
blood to filter out 2 quarts of urine. 

Besides removing urea and other nitrogenous wastes from the blood, the kidneys 
maintain the proper balance of water, electrolytes, and acids in body fluids. Electrolytes 
such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) are small molecules that conduct an electrical 
charge. Electrolytes are necessary for proper functioning of muscle and nerve cells. The 
kidney adjusts the amounts of water and electrolytes by secreting some substances into the 
urine and holding back others in the bloodstream for use in the body. 

In addition to forming and excreting (eliminating) urine from the body, the kidneys 
secrete hormones such as renin (REˉ -n..n) and erythropoietin (e.-r..th-roˉ-POˉ Y-e.-t..n). Renin 
raises blood pressure (to keep blood moving through the kidney). Erythropoietin (EPO) is 
a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. 

The kidneys also secrete calciferol, an active form of vitamin D, necessary for the 
absorption of calcium from the intestine. In addition, the kidneys degrade and eliminate 
hormones such as insulin and parathyroid hormone from the bloodstream. Box 7-1 reviews 
the functions of the kidneys. 

ANATOMY OF THE MAJOR ORGANS 

The following paragraphs describe the organs of the urinary system. Label Figure 7-1 as 
you identify each organ. 

The kidney [1] is one of two bean-shaped organs behind the abdominal cavity 
(retroperitoneal) on either side of the spine in the lumbar region. A cushion of adipose 
(fatty) tissue and fibrous connective tissue surrounds each kidney for protection. Each 
kidney (about the size of a fist) weighs about 4 to 6 ounces. 

The kidneys consist of an outer cortex region (cortex means bark, as the bark of a tree) 
and an inner medulla region (medulla means marrow). The hilum is a depression on the 
medial border of the kidney. Blood vessels and nerves pass through the hilum. 

The ureter [2] is one of two muscular tubes (16 to 18 inches long) lined with mucous 
membrane. Ureters carry urine in peristaltic waves from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 

The urinary bladder [3], a hollow, muscular sac, is a temporary reservoir for urine. The 
trigone is a triangular region at the base of the bladder where the ureters enter and the 
urethra exits.

BOX 7-1 FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEYS 

. Remove nitrogenous wastes: urea, creatinine, uric acid 
. Balance water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium) 
. Release hormones: renin, erythropoietin, calciferol 
. Degrade and eliminate hormones from bloodstream 


URINARY SYSTEM 217

The urethra [4] is a tube that carries urine from the urinary bladder to the outside of the 
body. The process of expelling urine through the urethra is called urination or voiding. 
The external opening of the urethra is the urinary meatus. The female urethra, about 
1. inches long, lies anterior to the vagina and vaginal meatus. The male urethra, about 
8 inches long, extends downward through the prostate gland to the urinary meatus at the 
tip of the penis. Figure 7-2 illustrates the female urinary system. Compare it with Figure 
7-1, which shows the male urinary system.

PHYSIOLOGY: HOW THE KIDNEYS PRODUCE URINE 

Blood enters each kidney from the aorta by way of the right and left renal arteries. After the 
renal artery enters the kidney (at the hilum), it branches into smaller and smaller arteries. 
The smallest arteries are called arterioles (Figure 7-3A). 

Because the arterioles are small, blood passes through them slowly but constantly. Blood 
flow through the kidney is so essential that the kidneys have their own special device for 
maintaining blood flow. If blood pressure falls in the vessels of the kidney, so that blood flow 
diminishes, the kidney produces renin and discharges it into the blood. Renin promotes the 
formation of a substance that stimulates the contraction of arterioles. This increases blood 
pressure and restores blood flow in the kidneys to normal.

(urea and creatinine), and sodium. (2) Tubular reabsorption of water, sugar, and sodium. (3) Tubular 
secretion of acids, potassium, and drugs. B, Nephron. 

Each arteriole in the cortex of the kidney leads into a mass of very tiny, coiled, and 
intertwined smaller blood vessels called glomeruli (see Figure 7-3A). Each glomerulus 
(singular) is a collection of tiny capillaries formed in the shape of a small ball. There are 
about 1 million glomeruli in the cortex region of each kidney. 

The kidneys produce urine by filtration. As blood passes through the many glomeruli, 
the thin walls of each glomerulus (the filter) permit water, salts, sugar, and urea (with 
other nitrogenous wastes such as creatinine and uric acid) to leave the bloodstream. 
These materials collect in a tiny, cup-like structure, a glomerular (Bowman) capsule, 
that surrounds each glomerulus (Figure 7-3B). The walls of the glomeruli prevent large 
substances, such as proteins and blood cells, from filtering into the capsule. These 
substances remain in the blood and normally do not appear in urine. 

Attached to each glomerular capsule is a long, twisted tube called a renal tubule (see 
Figures 7-3B and 7-4). As water, sugar, salts, urea, and other wastes pass through the renal 
tubule, most of the water, all of the sugar, and almost all of the sodium return to the 
bloodstream through tiny capillaries surrounding each tubule. This active process of 
reabsorption ensures that the body retains essential substances such as sugar (glucose), 
water, and sodium. The final process in the formation of urine is secretion of some 
substances from the bloodstream into the renal tubule. These waste products of metabolism 
become toxic if allowed to accumulate in the body. Thus, acids, drugs (such as penicillin), 
and potassium (as a salt) leave the body in urine. 

Only wastes, water, salts, acids, and some drugs (often as metabolites—partially 
broken-down forms of the original drug) remain in the renal tubule. Each renal tubule, 
now containing urine (95% water and 5% urea, creatinine, salts, acids, and drugs), ends in 
a larger collecting tubule. See Figure 7-4A, which reviews the steps involved in urine 
formation. The combination of a glomerulus and a renal tubule forms a unit called a 
nephron (Figure 7-4B). Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons.

URINARY SYSTEM 221 


All collecting tubules lead to the renal pelvis, a basin-like area in the central part of the 
kidney. Small, cup-like regions of the renal pelvis are called calyces or calices (singular: 
calyx or calix). Figure 7-5 is an x-ray image of a kidney showing the renal pelvis, calyces, 
and ureter. 

The renal pelvis narrows into the ureter, which carries the urine to the urinary bladder. 
The bladder, a muscular sac, temporarily stores urine. Sphincter muscles control the exit 
area of the bladder to the urethra. As the bladder fills and pressure increases at the base of 
the bladder, an individual notices a need to urinate and voluntarily relaxes sphincter 
muscles. 

Study the flow diagram in Figure 7-6 to trace the process of forming urine and expelling 
it from the body.

VOCABULARY 
arteriole Small artery. 
calciferol Active form of Vitamin D, secreted by the kidney. 
calyx or calix (plural: 
calyces or calices) 
Cup-like collecting region of the renal pelvis. The term comes from 
Greek, kalux meaning a cup or case surrounding a flower bud. 
catheter Tube for injecting or removing fluids. 
cortex Outer region of an organ; the renal cortex is the outer region of the 
kidney (cortical means pertaining to the cortex). 
creatinine Nitrogenous waste excreted in urine. Creatinine clearance is a measure 
of the efficiency of the kidneys in removing (clearing) creatinine from 
the blood. 
electrolyte Chemical element that carries an electrical charge when dissolved in 
water. Electrolytes are necessary for functioning of muscles and nerves. 
The kidneys maintain the proper balance of electrolytes and water in 
the blood. Potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) are electrolytes. 
erythropoietin (EPO) Hormone secreted by the kidney to stimulate the production of red 
blood cells by bone marrow. –Poietin means a substance that forms. 
filtration Process whereby some substances, but not all, pass through a filter. 
glomerular capsule Enclosing structure surrounding each glomerulus. The glomerular 
capsule is also known as Bowman’s capsule and it collects the material 
that is filtered from the blood through the walls of the glomerulus. 
glomerulus (plural: 
glomeruli) 
Tiny ball of capillaries (microscopic blood vessels) in the kidney. 
hilum Depression in an organ where blood vessels and nerves enter and leave. 
Hilum comes from the Latin meaning a small thing. It is also used in 
the respiratory system to mark the depression in the lung where blood 
vessels, bronchus, and lymphatic vessels enter and leave. 
Filtration of blood through the kidney. 
This process is maintained by output from the heart (25% of cardiac output goes to the kidneys) and adequate blood pressure 
to force blood through the glomerulus (filter). About 200 quarts (189L) of fluid are filtered daily but 98% to 99% of water and 
salts are returned to the blood. Only about 2 quarts (1500 mL) of urine are excreted daily.

URINALYSIS 

Urinalysis is an examination of urine to determine the presence of abnormal elements that 
may indicate various pathologic conditions. See Figure 7-10. 

The following are some of the tests included in a urinalysis:

 1. 
Color—Normal urine color is yellow (amber) or straw-colored. A colorless, pale urine 
indicates a large amount of water in the urine, whereas a smoky-red or brown color of 
urine indicates the presence of large amounts of blood. Foods such as beets and 
certain drugs also can produce a red coloration of urine. 
2. 
Appearance—Normally, urine should be clear. Cloudy or turbid urine indicates a 
urinary tract infection with pus (pyuria) and bacteria (bacteriuria). 
3. 
pH—Determination of pH reveals the chemical nature of urine. It indicates to what 
degree a solution is acid or alkaline (basic) (Figure 7-11). Normal urine is slightly 
acidic pH of 6.5. However, in some infections of the bladder, the urine pH may be 
alkaline, owing to the actions of bacteria in the urine that break down urea and release 
ammonia (an alkaline substance). 
4. 
Protein—Small amounts of protein are normally found in the urine but not in 
sufficient quantity to produce a positive result by ordinary methods of testing. When 
urinary tests for protein become positive, albumin is usually responsible. Albumin is 
the major protein in blood plasma. If it is detected in urine (albuminuria), it may 
indicate a leak in the glomerular membrane, which allows albumin to enter the renal 
tubule and pass into the urine. 
Through more sensitive testing, smaller abnormal amounts of albumin may be 
detected (microalbuminuria) when ordinary tests are negative. Microalbuminuria is 
recognized as the earliest sign of renal involvement in diabetes mellitus.

5. 
Glucose—Sugar is not normally found in the urine. In most cases, when it does 
appear (glycosuria), it indicates diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus, there is excess 
sugar in the bloodstream (hyperglycemia), which leads to the “spilling over” of sugar 
into the urine. The renal tubules cannot reabsorb all the sugar that filters out through 
the glomerular membrane. 
6. 
Specific gravity—The specific gravity of urine reflects the amounts of wastes, minerals, 
and solids in the urine. It is a comparison of the density of urine with that of water. 
The urine of patients with diabetes mellitus has a higher-than-normal specific gravity 
because of the presence of sugar. 
7. 
Ketone bodies—Ketones (or acetones, a type of ketone body) are formed when fatty 
acids are broken down in the liver. Ketones accumulate in blood and urine when the 
body breaks down fat, instead of sugar, for fuel. Ketonuria occurs in diabetes mellitus 
when cells deprived of sugar must use up their available fat for energy. In starvation, 
when sugar is not available, ketonuria and ketosis (ketones in the blood) occur as fat 
is catabolized abnormally. 
Ketones in the blood are dangerous because they increase the acidity of the blood 
(ketoacidosis). This can lead to coma (unconsciousness) and death.

 8. 
Sediment and casts—The presence of abnormal particles in the urine is a sign of a 
pathologic condition. Such particles, which may settle to the bottom of a urine sample 
as sediment, may include cells (epithelial cells, white blood cells, or red blood cells), 
bacteria, crystals, and casts (cylindrical structures of protein often containing cellular 
elements). 
9. 
Phenylketonuria (PKU)—This is a rare condition in which a baby is born unable to 
break down an amino acid, phenylalanine. Resulting high levels of phenylalanine 
(phenylketones are detected in urine) can lead to mental retardation. While the PKU 
test was originally performed on urine samples, now it is done via blood sample by 
pricking the newborn’s heel. If phenylalanine is detected, the infant is fed a low-
protein diet excluding phenylalanine. Affected children remain on this diet until 
adulthood. 
10. 
Bilirubin—This pigment substance, which results from hemoglobin breakdown, may 
be present in the urine (bilirubinuria) of patients with liver disease. Urobilinogen, a 
breakdown product of bilirubin, may also be found in the urine. 
PATHOLOGIC TERMINOLOGY: KIDNEY, BLADDER, 
AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS 

KIDNEY 
glomerulonephritis Inflammation of the glomeruli within the kidney. 
This condition can follow a streptococcal infection. It results in leaky glomeruli, 
hematuria, red blood cell casts, albuminuria, renal failure, and uremia. Drugs may 
be useful to control inflammation, and dialysis or renal transplantation may be 
necessary if uremia occurs. 
interstitial nephritis Inflammation of the connective tissue that lies between the renal 
tubules. 
The connective tissue lying between the renal tubules is called the renal 
interstitium. Acute interstitial nephritis, an increasingly common disorder, may 
develop after use of NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as 
ibuprofen) and other drugs. It may be marked by fever, skin rash, and eosinophils 
in the blood and urine.

230 URINARY SYSTEM 
nephrolithiasis Kidney stones (renal calculi). 
Kidney stones usually are composed of uric acid or calcium salts. Stones often 
lodge in the ureter or bladder, as well as in the renal pelvis, and may require 
removal by lithotripsy (see page 234) or surgery. 
nephrotic syndrome 
(nephrosis) 
Group of clinical signs and symptoms caused by excessive protein loss 
in urine. 
Nephrotic syndrome may follow glomerulonephritis or exposure to toxins or 
certain drugs, immune diseases, and other pathologic conditions, such as diabetes 
mellitus and cancer. Two important signs of nephrotic syndrome are edema 
(swelling caused by fluid in tissue spaces) and hypoalbuminemia. Both of these 
signs are caused by massive leakage of protein into urine. 
polycystic kidney disease 
(PKD) 
Multiple fluid-filled sacs (cysts) within and on the kidney. 
There are two types of hereditary PKD. One type is usually asymptomatic (without 
symptoms) until middle age and then is marked by hematuria, urinary tract 
infections, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure. The other type of PKD occurs in 
infants or children and results in renal failure. Figure 7-12A shows polycystic 
kidney disease. 
pyelonephritis Inflammation of the lining of the renal pelvis and renal parenchyma. 
The parenchyma of an organ is its essential and distinctive tissue. Nephrons are 
the renal parenchyma. Bacterial infection in the urinary tract causes collections 
of pus to form in the kidney, often associated with bacteria spilling into the 
bloodstream. Urinalysis reveals pyuria. Treatment consists of antibiotics and 
surgical correction of any obstruction to urine flow. 
renal cell carcinoma 
(hypernephroma) 
Cancerous tumor of the kidney in adulthood. 
This tumor (see Figure 7-12B) accounts for 2% of all cancers in adults. Hematuria 
is the primary abnormal finding, and the tumor often metastasizes to bones and 
lungs. Nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is the primary treatment.

URINARY SYSTEM 231 


renal failure Decrease in excretion of wastes results from impaired filtration 
function. 
A large number of conditions, including high blood pressure, infection, and 
diabetes, can lead to renal failure, which may be acute (ARF) or chronic (CRF), 
reversible or progressive, mild or severe. A newer classification of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stages patients according to the level of creatinine clearance and 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), ranging from normal (stage 1) to end-stage renal 
failure (stage 5). See page 237 under CKD stages. 
renal hypertension High blood pressure resulting from kidney disease. 
Renal hypertension is the most common type of secondary hypertension (high 
blood pressure caused by an abnormal condition such as glomerulonephritis). If 
the cause of high blood pressure is not known, the condition is called essential 
hypertension. Chronic essential hypertension causes arterial and arteriolar 
damage, potentially resulting in stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart 
failure, or renal failure. 
Wilms tumor Malignant tumor of the kidney occurring in childhood. 
This tumor may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. 

URINARY BLADDER 

bladder cancer 
Malignant tumor of the urinary bladder. 

Bladder cancer occurs more frequently in men (often smokers) and in persons 
older than 50 years of age, especially industrial workers exposed to dyes and 
leather tanning agents. Signs and symptoms include gross (visible to the naked 
eye) or microscopic hematuria and dysuria. Cystoscopy with biopsy is the most 
common diagnostic procedure. Staging of the tumor is based on the depth 
to which the tumor invades the bladder wall and presence of metastasis. 
Superficial tumors are removed by electrocauterization (burning). Cystectomy, 
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are treatments for disease that has spread 
deeply into the bladder wall, to regional lymph nodes, or to distant organs. 

ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS 

diabetes insipidus (DI) 
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is not secreted, or there is a resistance of 
the kidney to ADH. 

In DI, the kidney produces large amounts of dilute urine (polyuria). Lack of ADH 
prevents water from being reabsorbed into the blood through the renal tubules. 
Insipidus means tasteless, reflecting very dilute and watery urine, not sweet as in 
diabetes mellitus. The term diabetes comes from the Greek diabainein, meaning 
to pass through. Both types of diabetes (insipidus and mellitus) are marked by 
polyuria and polydipsia. 

diabetes mellitus (DM) 
Insulin is not secreted adequately or tissues are resistant to its effects. 

The major signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus are glycosuria, hyperglycemia, 
polyuria, and polydipsia. Without insulin, sugar cannot leave the bloodstream and 
is not available to body cells for energy. Sugar remains in the blood (hyperglycemia) 
and spills over into the urine (glycosuria). Mellitus means sweet, reflecting the 
content of the urine. The term diabetes, when used alone, refers to diabetes 
mellitus. See Chapter 18 for more information about diabetes mellitus.

232 URINARY SYSTEM 

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

LABORATORY TESTS 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Measurement of urea levels in blood. 
Normally, the blood urea level is low because urea is excreted in the urine 
continuously. However, when the kidney is diseased or fails, urea accumulates in 
the blood (uremia), leading to unconsciousness and death. 
creatinine clearance Measurement of the rate at which creatinine is cleared from the blood 
by the kidney. 
This is an important test to assess the functioning of the kidney. A blood sample 
is drawn and the creatinine concentration in blood is compared with the amount 
of creatinine excreted in the urine during a fixed time period. If the kidney is not 
functioning well in its job of clearing creatinine from the blood, the amount of 
creatinine in the blood will be high relative to the amount in urine. Creatinine 
clearance is a useful indicator of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which 
normally is 90 to 120 mL/minute. 
CLINICAL PROCEDURES 
X-Ray Studies 
CT urography X-ray images obtained using computed tomography show multiple 
cross-sectional and other views of the kidney. 
CT scanners show multiple views of the kidney, taken with or without contrast 
material. Two main indications are to detect kidney stones and to evaluate patients 
with hematuria. (Figure 7-13A). 
kidneys, ureters, and bladder 
(KUB) 
X-ray examination (without contrast) of the kidneys, ureters, and 
bladder. 
A KUB study demonstrates the size and location of the kidneys in relation to other 
organs in the abdominopelvic region. 
renal angiography X-ray examination (with contrast) of the blood vessels of the kidney. 
This procedure helps diagnose obstruction or constriction of blood vessels leading 
to the kidney. The same changes can be seen on CT and MRI urography.

retrograde pyelogram (RP) X-ray image of the renal pelvis and ureters after injection of contrast 
through a urinary catheter into the ureters from the bladder. 
This technique is useful in locating urinary stones and obstructions. 
voiding cystourethrogram 
(VCUG) 
X-ray image (with contrast) of the urinary bladder and urethra obtained 
while the patient is voiding. See Figure 7-13B. 
The bladder is filled with contrast material, followed by fluoroscopy (real-time 
x-ray imaging). Reflux of contrast into the ureters is abnormal and may occur 
with recurrent urinary tract infections. 
Ultrasound Examination 
ultrasonography Imaging of urinary tract structures using high-frequency sound waves. 
Kidney size, tumors, hydronephrosis, polycystic kidney disease, and ureteral and 
bladder obstruction can be diagnosed using ultrasound techniques. 
Radioactive Study 
radioisotope scan Image of the kidney obtained after injecting a radioactive substance 
(radioisotope) into the bloodstream. 
Pictures show the size and shape of the kidney (renal scan) and its functioning 
(renogram). These studies can indicate narrowing of blood vessels, diagnose 
obstruction, and determine the individual functioning of each kidney. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
MRI urography Changing magnetic field produces images of the kidney and 
surrounding structures in three planes of the body. 
The patient lies within a cylindrical magnetic resonance machine, and images are 
made of the pelvic and retroperitoneal regions using magnetic waves. This test is 
useful in visualizing tumor invasion of blood vessels, lymph nodes, and adjacent 
tissues. 
OTHER PROCEDURES 
cystoscopy Direct visualization of the urethra and urinary bladder with an 
endoscope (cystoscope). 
The procedure can be performed in two ways. Flexible cystoscopy uses a thin 
fiberoptic cystoscope and is used for diagnosis and check-ups of the urinary 
bladder. Rigid cystoscopy uses a hollow metal tube, passed through the urethra 
and into the bladder. It is used to take biopsy samples, remove polyps, or perform 
laser treatments. (Figure 7-14A and B).

234 URINARY SYSTEM 


dialysis 
Process of separating nitrogenous waste materials from the blood. 

Dialysis is used to treat acute or chronic renal failure and some cases of drug use. 
There are two methods: 

1. 
Hemodialysis (HD) uses an artificial kidney machine that receives waste-
filled blood from the patient’s bloodstream, filters it through an artificial 
porous membrane (dialyzer), and returns the dialyzed blood to the patient’s 
body (Figure 7-15A). An arteriovenous fistula (communication between an 
artery and vein) is created surgically to provide easy access for hemodialysis 
(Figure 7-15B). 
2. 
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) uses a catheter to introduce fluid into the peritoneal 
(abdominal) cavity. Waste materials, such as urea, in the capillaries of the 
peritoneum pass out of the bloodstream and into the fluid. The fluid (with 
wastes) is then removed by catheter. When used to treat patients with chronic 
kidney disease, PD may be performed continuously by the patient without 
mechanical support (CAPD—continuous ambulatory PD; Figure 7-16) or with 
the aid of a mechanical apparatus used at night during sleep. 
lithotripsy 
Urinary tract stones are crushed. 
The extracorporeal method uses shock waves directed toward the stone from the 
outside of the body (extra = outside, corpor/o = body). The patient receives light 
sedation or an anesthetic. Stones pass from the body in urine after the procedure. 
Abbreviation is ESWL (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy).

bag is unfolded, and the fluid is allowed to drain into it by gravity. The full bag is discarded, and a new bag of 
fresh dialysate is attached. 
renal angioplasty Dilation of narrowed areas in renal arteries. 
A balloon attached to a catheter is inserted into the artery and then inflated to 
enlarge the vessel diameter. Afterward, stents (metal-mesh tubes) may be inserted 
to keep the vessel open. This procedure is used to treat renal hypertension and to 
preserve renal function. 
renal biopsy Removal of kidney tissue for microscopic examination. 
Biopsy may be performed at the time of surgery (open) or through the skin 
(percutaneous, or closed). When the latter technique is used, the patient lies in the 
prone position; then, after administration of local anesthesia to the overlying skin 
and muscles of the back, the physician inserts a biopsy needle downward into the 
kidney. Several specimens are obtained for examination by a pathologist.

renal transplantation Surgical transfer of a kidney from a donor to a recipient. 

Patients with renal failure may receive a kidney from a living donor, such as an 
identical twin (isograft) or other person (allograft), or from a patient at the time 
of death (cadaver transplant). Best results occur when the donor is closely related 
to the recipient—98% of transplanted kidneys survive for 1 year or longer (Figure 
7-17). See In Person account, page 240, of a kidney transplant donor. 

urinary catheterization Passage of a flexible, tubular instrument through the urethra into the 

urinary bladder. 
Catheters are used primarily for short- or long-term drainage of urine. A Foley 
catheter is an indwelling (left in the bladder) catheter held in place by a balloon 
inflated with liquid (Figure 7-18).

240 URINARY SYSTEM 


IN PERSON 


This first-person narrative was written by a kidney donor. 

When my 64 year-old father-in-law announced to my wife and 
me that his kidney function was failing, it didn’t really enter our 
minds that one of us might ultimately have a part to play in his 
survival. Five years later, dialysis was taking its toll on his organ 
systems, and there had been no success in obtaining a cadaveric 
kidney. Things had reached the point where he needed a kidney 
in short order, before his health deteriorated to the point where 
he would no longer be a candidate for transplantation. 

My wife’s blood type ruled out the possibility of her being a 
direct donor, so I volunteered to be tested. Turns out that we 
were a match on 5 of the 7 key traits—a really good fit! The next round of testing—blood work and my kidney 
function—was able to be done locally. I remember carrying around a specimen container (on ice), having to 
provide a full liter of urine in 24 hours! 

The results of those tests were favorable, and two weeks later I made the 3.-hour drive to the transplant 
center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. While a transplant is really a team of two—donor and 
recipient—the entire process at UVA was very much individualized. A transplant coordinator (an experienced 
RN) was assigned specifically to our case, and I had a team of doctors and support staff dedicated exclusively 
to me, the donor. Similarly, there was a team that dealt only with my father-in-law as the recipient. 

My visit involved some more in-depth blood tests and cardiac studies largely to determine that I was healthy 
enough for major surgery. My transplant team and I spent an entire afternoon discussing the implications of 
being a donor—the inherent risk in any surgery, potential implications for me and my family, the likely 
recovery time, and the possibility that, despite all of the up-front testing, the transplant might not be successful. 
The discussions that afternoon only reaffirmed that I was making the right decision. I had an opportunity to 
positively impact someone else’s life, with relatively little risk to my own health. 

The events around the surgery itself were pretty straightforward. We drove up from Greensboro on 
Wednesday evening, with the surgery scheduled for 8:00 AM Thursday morning. I didn’t get much sleep that 
night—I watched my favorite “comfort” movie, “Love Actually,” at 3:00 AM—but was excited and ready to go 
in the morning. As you might imagine, the moments immediately before going into pre-op were very emotional 
for all of us. We shed a lot of tears—of apprehension for the surgeries and of joy at the prospect of a new 
beginning for my father-in-law. The surgery is a more involved procedure for the donor than for the recipient, 
so I was taken back first. A nurse started an IV and pushed a mild sedative. From that point, my only memory 
is of one last hug for my wife and children, and then being shifted from the stretcher onto the operating table. 

When I woke up in recovery, the news was all good. My surgery had gone well—four laparoscopic incisions 
through which the surgeons did most all of their work, and a lateral incision in my lower abdomen through 
which the kidney was removed. Equally important, my father-in-law had come through his surgery well and 
the kidney had immediately begun to function! I was discharged from the hospital on Sunday, and cleared to 
return home the next Friday, 8 days post-op. 

All told, I was out of work for 12 days—2 days the week of the surgery and the following 2 weeks. As is typical 
following a major surgery, it took about 6 weeks for me to feel “normal” again. During those 6 weeks, I had 
weekly blood tests to chart the progress of my kidney function. I went back to UVA for a routine follow-up visit 
at the 6 week mark. I was recovering as expected, and my remaining kidney was actually growing in size and 
capacity. Blood tests continued on a monthly basis until I was officially “discharged” from the transplant 
center’s care six months after the surgery.

URINARY SYSTEM 241 

Now, 5 years after the transplant, both my father-in-law and I continue to do well. As my mother-in-law likes 
to say, I donated a “rock star” kidney that has allowed our family to enjoy many visits and create many 
cherished memories that will last a lifetime. My two children, now 17 and 14, have enjoyed their grandfather’s 
love and guidance during some very important years in their lives. This is especially meaningful to me, as I 
lost my father before my wife and I started our family, and our children missed out on an opportunity to know 
and love a wonderful man. 

John Melson lives in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his wife and two wonderful children. He is a finance and marketing 
executive with a global textile firm, and enjoys golf, tennis, and traveling. He is pictured with his father-in-law, Rod Beckwith.

1. Hematuria is the presence of blood 
in the urine, and uremia is a 
toxic condition of excess urea 
(nitrogenous waste) in the 
bloodstream. Hematuria is a 
symptomatic condition of the urine 
(-uria), and uremia is an abnormal 
condition of the blood (-emia).

of urine (polyuria). 
3. A diuretic is a drug or chemical 
(caffeine or alcohol) that causes 
diuresis to occur. 
4. Antidiuretic hormone is a hormone 
produced by the pituitary gland 
that normally helps the renal

the bloodstream. It works against 
diuresis to help retain water in the 
blood. 
5. Hyponatremia is abnormally 
low levels of sodium in the

258 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 


8 
INTRODUCTION 

Sexual reproduction is the union of the nuclei of the ovum (the female sex cell) and the 
sperm cell (the male sex cell) that results in the creation of an embryo. The ovum and the 
sperm cell are specialized cells that differ from normal body cells. Each sex cell, known as 
a gamete, contains exactly half the number of chromosomes of a normal body cell. When 
the nuclei of ovum and sperm cell unite, the cell produced receives half of its genetic 
material from its female parent and half from its male parent; thus, it contains a full, normal 
complement of hereditary material. 

Special organs called gonads in males and females produce the egg and sperm cells. The 
female gonads are the ovaries, and the male gonads are the testes. After an ovum leaves the 
ovary, it travels down one of two fallopian tubes leading to the uterus (womb). If coitus 
(copulation, sexual intercourse) has occurred and sperm cells travel into the fallopian tube, 
they can penetrate the ovum. This is fertilization. The fertilized ovum is then known as a 
zygote. After many cell divisions, a ball of cells forms, and the zygote is called an embryo (2 
to 8 weeks) and finally a fetus (8 to 38 or 40 weeks). The period of development within the 
uterus is gestation, or pregnancy. 

The female reproductive system consists of organs that produce ova and provide a place 
for the growth of the embryo. In addition, the female reproductive organs supply important 
hormones that contribute to the development of female secondary sex characteristics (body 
hair, breast development, structural changes in bones and fat). 

The eggs, or ova, are present from birth in the female ovary but begin to mature and are 
released from the ovary in a 21- to 28-day cycle when secondary sex characteristics develop. 
The occurrence of the first cycle is called menarche. Menstrual cycles continue until 
menopause, when all eggs have been released, hormone production diminishes, and 
menstruation ends. If fertilization occurs during the years between menarche and 
menopause, the fertilized egg may grow and develop within the uterus. A new, blood vessel– 
rich organ called a placenta (connected to the embryo by the umbilical cord) develops to 
nourish the embryo, which implants in the uterine lining. Various hormones are secreted 
from the ovary and from the placenta to stimulate the expansion of the placenta. If 
fertilization does not occur, hormone changes result in shedding of the uterine lining, and 
bleeding, or menstruation, occurs. 

The hormones of the ovaries, estrogen and progesterone, play important roles in the 
processes of menstruation and pregnancy, and in the development of secondary sex 
characteristics. The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, secretes other hormones 
that govern the reproductive functions of the ovaries, breasts, and uterus. 

Gynecology is the study of the female reproductive system (organs, hormones, and 
diseases); obstetrics (Latin obstetrix means midwife) is a specialty concerned with 
pregnancy and the delivery of the fetus; and neonatology is the study of the care and 
treatment of the newborn. 

ORGANS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 

UTERUS, OVARIES, AND ASSOCIATED ORGANS 

Label Figures 8-1 and 8-3 as you read the following description of the female reproductive 
system. 

Figure 8-1 shows a side view of the female reproductive organs and their relationship to 
the other organs in the pelvic cavity. The ovaries [1] (only one ovary is shown in this lateral 
view) are a pair of small almond-shaped organs located in the pelvis. The fallopian tubes [2] 
(only one is shown in this view) lead from each ovary to the uterus [3], which is a 



FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 259 
8 
fibromuscular organ situated between the urinary bladder and the rectum. The uterus 
(womb) normally is the size and shape of a pear and is about 3 inches long in a nonpregnant 
woman. Midway between the uterus and the rectum is a region in the abdominal cavity 
known as the cul-de-sac [4]. 
The vagina [5], a tubular structure, extends from the uterus to the exterior of the body. 
Bartholin glands [6] are two small, rounded glands on either side of the vaginal orifice. 
These glands produce a mucous secretion that lubricates the vagina. The clitoris [7] is an 
organ of sensitive, erectile tissue located anterior to the vaginal orifice and in front of the 
urethral meatus. The region between the vaginal orifice and the anus is the perineum [8]. 
The external genitalia of the female are collectively called the vulva. Figure 8-2 shows the 
various structures that are part of the vulva. The labia majora, the outer lips of the vagina, 
surround the smaller, inner lips, the labia minora. The hymen, a thin membrane partially 
covering the entrance to the vagina, is broken apart during the first episode of intercourse. 
The clitoris and Bartholin glands also are parts of the vulva.

260 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 


Figure 8-3 shows an anterior view of the female reproductive system. Each ovary [1] is 
held in place on either side of the uterus by a utero-ovarian ligament [2]. 

Within each ovary are thousands of small sacs—the ovarian follicles [3]. Each follicle 
contains an ovum [4]. During ovulation, an ovum matures; its follicle ruptures through the 
surface and releases the ovum from the ovary. A ruptured follicle fills with a yellow, fat-like 
material. It is then called the corpus luteum [5], meaning yellow body. The corpus luteum 
secretes hormones (both estrogen and progesterone) that maintain the very first stages of 
pregnancy. 

A fallopian tube [6] is about 5. inches long and lies near each ovary. Collectively, the 
fallopian tubes, ovaries, and supporting ligaments are the adnexae (accessory structures) of 
the uterus. The finger-like ends of the fallopian tube are the fimbriae [7]. They catch the 
egg after its release from the ovary. Cilia (small hairs) line the fallopian tube and, through 
their motion, sweep the ovum along. It usually takes the ovum about 2 to 3 days to pass 
through the fallopian tube. 

If sperm cells are present in the fallopian tube, fertilization may occur (Figure 8-4). If 
sperm cells are not present, the ovum remains unfertilized and eventually disintegrates. 

The fallopian tubes, one on each side, lead into the uterus [8], a pear-shaped organ with 
muscular walls and a mucous membrane lining filled with a rich supply of blood vessels. 
The rounded upper portion of the uterus is the fundus, and the larger, central section is the 
corpus (body of the organ). The inner layer, a specialized epithelial mucosa of the uterus is 
the endometrium [9]; the middle, muscular layer of the uterine wall is the myometrium 
[10]; and the outer, membranous tissue layer is the uterine serosa [11], a lining that 
produces a watery, serum-like secretion. The outermost layer of an organ in the abdomen 
or thorax is known as a serosa. 

The narrow, lowermost portion of the uterus is the cervix [12] (Latin cervix means neck). 

The cervical opening leads into a 3-inch-long muscular, mucosa-lined canal called the 

vagina [13], which opens to the outside of the body.

THE BREAST (ACCESSORY ORGAN OF REPRODUCTION) 

Label Figure 8-5 as you read the following description of breast structures. 

The breasts, located on the upper anterior region of the chest, are composed mostly of 
mammary glands. The glandular tissue [1] contains milk glands or lobules that develop in 
response to hormones from the ovaries during puberty. The breasts also contain fibrous 
and fatty tissue [2], special lactiferous (milk-carrying) ducts [3], and sinuses (cavities) [4] 
that carry milk to the nipple, which has small openings for the ducts to release their milk. 
The breast nipple is the mammary papilla [5], and the dark pigmented area around the 
mammary papilla is the areola [6]. 

During pregnancy the hormones from the ovaries and the placenta stimulate glandular 
and other tissues in the breasts to their full development. After parturition (giving birth), 
hormones from the pituitary gland stimulate the normal secretion of milk (lactation).

MENSTRUATION AND PREGNANCY 
MENSTRUAL CYCLE (FIGURE 8-6) 
Menarche, or onset of menstruation with the first menstrual cycle, occurs at the time of 
puberty. An average menstrual cycle lasts for 28 days but may be shorter or longer, and 
cycles may be irregular in length. These days can be divided into four time periods, useful 
in describing the events of the cycle. The approximate time periods are as follows: 
Days 1 to 5 (menstrual period) 
Discharge of bloody fluid containing disintegrated endometrial cells, glandular secretions, 
and blood cells. 
Days 6 to 12 
After bleeding ceases, the endometrium begins to repair itself. The maturing follicle in 
the ovary releases estrogen, which aids in the repair. The ovum grows in the follicle 
during this period. 
Days 13 and 14 (ovulatory period) 
On about the 14th day of the cycle, the follicle ruptures and the egg leaves the ovary 
(ovulation), passing through the fallopian tube. 
Days 15 to 28 
The empty follicle fills with a yellow material and becomes the corpus luteum. The 
corpus luteum functions as an endocrine organ and secretes the hormone progesterone 
into the bloodstream. This hormone stimulates the building up of the lining of the uterus 
in anticipation of fertilization of the egg and pregnancy. 
If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum in the ovary stops producing 
progesterone and regresses. At this time, lowered levels of progesterone and estrogen 
probably are responsible for some women’s symptoms of depression, breast tenderness, 
and irritability before menstruation. The combination of these symptoms is known as 
premenstrual syndrome (PMS). After 2 days of decrease in hormones, the uterine 
endometrium breaks down, and the menstrual period begins (days 1 to 5).

FIGURE 8-6 The menstrual cycle. Tip: Don’t try to memorize this figure. Just get the big picture! In the ovary, as the ovum 
matures, hormone levels rise, culminating in ovulation (days 13 and 14). At the same time, in the uterus the endometrium is 
building up in anticipation of pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, hormone levels drop and menstruation begins.


FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 263 


Note: Cycles vary in length, ranging from 21 to 42 days or longer. Ovulation typically 
occurs 14 days before the end of the cycle. A woman with a 42-day cycle ovulates on day 
28, whereas a woman with a 21-day cycle ovulates on day 7. 

PREGNANCY 

If fertilization does occur in the fallopian tube, the fertilized egg travels to the uterus and 
implants in the uterine endometrium. The corpus luteum in the ovary continues to produce 
progesterone and estrogen. These hormones support the vascular and glandular development 
of the uterine lining. 

The placenta, a vascular organ, now forms, attached to the uterine wall. The placenta is 
derived from maternal endometrium and from the chorion, the outermost membrane that 
surrounds the developing embryo. The amnion, the innermost of the embryonic membranes, 
holds the fetus suspended in an amniotic cavity surrounded by a fluid called the amniotic 
fluid. The amnion with its fluid is also known as the “bag of waters” or amniotic sac, which 
ruptures (breaks) during labor. 

The maternal blood and the fetal blood never mix during pregnancy, but important 
nutrients, oxygen, and wastes are exchanged as the blood vessels of the fetus (coming from 
the umbilical cord) lie side by side with the mother’s blood vessels in the placenta. Figure 
8-7A and B shows implantation in the uterus and the embryo’s relationship to the placenta 
and enveloping membranes (chorion and amnion). 

As the placenta develops in the uterus, it produces its own hormone, human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG). When women test their urine with a pregnancy test kit, presence 
or absence of hCG confirms or rules out that they are pregnant. This hormone stimulates 
the corpus luteum to continue producing hormones until about the third month of 
pregnancy, when the placenta takes over the endocrine function and releases estrogen and 
progesterone. Progesterone maintains the development of the placenta. Low levels of 
progesterone can lead to spontaneous abortion in pregnant women and menstrual 
irregularities in nonpregnant women.

FIGURE 8-8 The growing uterus changes the pelvic anatomy during pregnancy, as shown here in sagittal 
section: A, nonpregnant woman, B, 20 weeks pregnant, C, 30 weeks pregnant. 
The uterus normally lies within the pelvis. During pregnancy the uterus expands as the 
fetus grows, and the superior part rises out of the pelvic cavity to become an abdominal 
organ. By about 28 to 30 weeks, it occupies a large part of the abdominopelvic cavity and 
reaches the epigastric region (Figure 8-8). 
The onset of true labor is marked by rhythmic contractions, dilation and thinning 
(effacement) of the cervix, and a discharge of bloody mucus from the cervix and vagina (the 
“show”). In a normal delivery position, the baby’s head appears first (cephalic presentation). 
After vaginal delivery of the baby, the placenta follows, and the umbilical cord is cut (Figure 
8-9). Figures 8-10A and B are photographs of a newborn and the placenta with attached 
cord, minutes after birth. The expelled placenta is the afterbirth.

Forceful contractions expel the placenta and attached membranes, now called the afterbirth. The three phases 
of labor are (1) dilation of the cervix, (2) expulsion or birth of the infant, and (3) delivery of the placenta.

delicate skin from abrasions, chapping, and hardening as a result of being bathed in amniotic fluid. 
B, The placenta and umbilical cord just after expulsion from the uterus. 

HORMONAL INTERACTIONS 

The events of menstruation and pregnancy depend on hormones not only from the ovaries 
(estrogen and progesterone) but also from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland secretes 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) after the onset of 
menstruation. As their levels rise in the bloodstream, FSH and LH stimulate maturation 
of the ovum and ovulation. After ovulation, LH in particular influences the maintenance 
of the corpus luteum and its production of estrogen and progesterone. 

During pregnancy, the high levels of estrogen and progesterone from the ovary and 
placenta cause the pituitary gland to stop producing FSH and LH. Therefore, while a woman 
is pregnant, additional eggs do not mature and ovulation cannot occur. Oral contraceptives 

8 
(birth control pills) work in the same way. 



Another female birth control method is an IUD (intrauterine device). A physician inserts 
the IUD, a small device designed to remain inside the uterus. It works by preventing 
implantation of the embryo. Birth control pills and an IUD do not protect a woman against 
sexually transmitted disease or HIV infection. See page 290 for a table of contraceptive 
choices and their features. 

When all of the ova are released and secretion of estrogen from the ovaries lessens, 
menopause begins. Menopause signals the gradual ending of the menstrual cycle. 
Premature menopause occurs before age 45, whereas delayed menopause occurs after 
age 55. Artificial menopause occurs if the ovaries are removed by surgery or made 
nonfunctional as a result of radiation therapy or some forms of chemotherapy. 


How do birth control pills work? 

Birth control pills contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone. When taken as directed, they increase the levels of 
these hormones in your bloodstream. High levels of estrogen and progesterone send a signal to the pituitary gland to shut 
down its secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). When these hormones are blocked, the 
ovaries will NOT release eggs and pregnancy cannot occur! During pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone are ALSO 
high, and the ovaries will not release eggs then either! So, birth control pills effectively fool the body into “thinking” that you are 
pregnant and your ovaries stop producing eggs. 



266 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 


During menopause, when estrogen levels fall, the most common signs and symptoms are 
hot flashes (temperature regulation in the brain is disturbed), insomnia, and vaginal 
atrophy (lining of the vagina dries and thins, predisposing the affected woman to irritation 
and discomfort during sexual intercourse). Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), given 
orally or as a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, relieves these symptoms of menopause and 
delays the development of weak bones (osteoporosis). HRT use may be associated with an 
increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, stroke, or heart attack. This therapy 
should be used only after careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.

PATHOLOGY: GYNECOLOGIC, BREAST, PREGNANCY, 
AND NEONATAL 


GYNECOLOGIC 

Uterus 

carcinoma of the cervix Malignant cells within the cervix (cervical cancer). 
Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important cause of 
and risk factor for cervical cancer. Other factors that may act together with HPV 
to increase the risk of developing cervical cancer include cigarette smoking, 
having multiple sexual partners, and having a weakened immune system (e.g., 
patients with AIDS). HPV infection is one of the most common sexually 
transmitted infections in the world. Some types of HPV cause genital warts 
(benign growths on the vulva, cervix, vagina, or anus), whereas others cause 
cancer, especially HPV types 16 and 18. 
Although most HPV infections do not progress to cervical cancer, the risk of 
developing cancer increases as Pap tests (see page 282) become abnormal and 
biopsies reveal dysplasia (abnormal cell growth), or more seriously, carcinoma in 
situ (CIS), a localized form of cancer (Figure 8-14). Local resection (conization) 
may be necessary to treat CIS and prevent development of invasive cancer. Figure 
8-15 shows a normal cervix and one with cervical cancer. 
Surgical treatment for cervical cancer requires radical (complete) hysterectomy, 
in which the entire uterus with ligaments, supportive tissues, and the top one 
third of the vagina are removed. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are used to 
treat disease that has spread beyond the uterus, into the pelvis, and to distant 
organs.

FIGURE 8-14 Preinvasive neoplastic lesions are called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Pathologists diagnose such lesions 
from a Pap test (microscopic examination of cells scraped from cervical epithelium) and grade them as CIN I to CIN III. 

 HPV Vaccine 

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Gardasil, the first vaccine developed to prevent cervical 
cancer, precancerous genital lesions, and genital warts due to human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV 
vaccine is recommended for girls 11 to 12 years of age. The vaccine is also recommended for females aged 13 to 26 years 
who have not been previously vaccinated. It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their first sexual contact. For these 
girls, the vaccine can prevent almost 100% of disease caused by the four types of HPV targeted by the vaccine. Papillomavirus 
also causes cancer of the throat (oropharynx) and nasal passages and cancer of the penis. The FDA has licensed two HPV 
vaccines for use in young males.

cervicitis Inflammation of the cervix. 
This condition can become chronic because the lining of the cervix is not renewed 
each month as is the uterine lining during menstruation. 
Bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae commonly 
cause cervicitis. Acute cervicitis, marked by cervical erosions or ulcerations, 
appears as raw, red patches on the cervical mucosa. Leukorrhea (clear, white, or 
yellow pus-filled vaginal discharge) also is a sign of cervical erosion. 
After the presence of malignancy has been excluded (by Pap test or biopsy), 
cryocauterization (destroying tissue by freezing) of the eroded area and treatment 
with antibiotics may be indicated. 
carcinoma of the 
endometrium (endometrial 
cancer) 
Malignant tumor of the uterine lining (adenocarcinoma). 
The most common sign of endometrial cancer is postmenopausal bleeding. This 
malignancy occurs more often in women exposed to high levels of estrogen, either 
from exogenous estrogen (pills) or estrogen-producing tumors or with obesity 
(estrogen is produced by fat tissue) and in nulliparous women. Physicians perform 
endometrial biopsy, hysteroscopy, and dilation or dilatation (widening the cervical 
canal) and curettage (scraping the inner lining of the uterus) for diagnosis. 
When the cancer is confined to the uterus, surgery (hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy) is curative. Radiation oncologists administer radiation 
therapy as additional treatment. 
endometriosis Endometrial tissue located outside the uterus. 
Endometrial tissue may be found in ovaries, fallopian tubes, supporting ligaments 
or small intestine, causing inflammation and scar tissue. When the endometrium 
sheds and bleeds in its monthly cycle, it may cause dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain. 
Infertility (inability to become pregnant) and dyspareunia may also occur. Most 
cases are the result of growth of bits of menstrual endometrium that have passed 
backward through the lumen (opening) of the fallopian tube and into the 
peritoneal cavity. Often, when disease affects the ovaries, large blood-filled 
cysts (endometriomas, or “chocolate cysts”) develop. Treatment ranges from 
symptomatic relief of pain and hormonal drugs that suppress the menstrual cycle 
to surgical removal of ectopic endometrial tissue and hysterectomy.

276 FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 

fibroids 
Benign tumors in the uterus. 
Fibroids, also called leiomyomata or leiomyomas (lei/o = smooth, my/o = muscle, 
and -oma = tumor), are composed of fibrous tissue and muscle. If fibroids grow 
too large and cause symptoms such as metrorrhagia, pelvic pain, or menorrhagia, 
hysterectomy or myomectomy is indicated. Fibroid ablation (destruction) without 
surgery may be accomplished by uterine artery embolization (UAE), in which tiny 
pellets (acting as emboli) are injected into a uterine artery, blocking the blood 
supply to fibroids, causing them to shrink. Figure 8-16, A and B, show the location 
of uterine fibroids. 

Ovaries 

ovarian carcinoma (cancer) 
Malignant tumor of the ovary (adenocarcinoma). 

Each year, about 22,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. Two types of ovarian cancer are most common: serous (clear fluid) and 
mucinous (thick, pasty fluid) cystic adenocarcinomas. The tumor usually is 
discovered in an advanced stage as an abdominal mass and may produce few 
symptoms in its early stages. In most patients, the disease metastasizes beyond the 
ovary before diagnosis and often causes ascites (accumulation of fluid in the 
abdominal cavity). Treatment consists of total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy, and removal of the omentum, which often contains 
deposits of tumor, followed by chemotherapy. A protein marker produced by 
tumor cells, CA 125, can be measured in the bloodstream to assess effectiveness of 
treatment. 

Inherited mutations (changes) in genes greatly increase the risk of developing 
ovarian and breast cancer. These mutations are BRCA1 and BRCA2 (short for 
breast cancer 1 and breast cancer 2). Women with a strong family history of 
ovarian cancer (with multiple members of the family affected) may seek genetic 
counseling to determine if they should be tested for these inherited defects. 
Prophylactic (preventive) oophorectomy significantly reduces the odds of 
developing ovarian cancer if a woman is at high risk.

ovarian cysts Collections of fluid within a sacs (cysts) in the ovary. 
Some cysts are benign and lined by typical cells of the ovary. These cysts originate 
in unruptured ovarian follicles (follicular cysts) or in follicles that have ruptured 
and have immediately been sealed (luteal cysts). Other cysts are malignant and 
lined with atypical or tumor cells (cystadenocarcinomas). Physicians decide to 
remove these cysts to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. 
Dermoid cysts contain a variety of cell types, including skin, hair, teeth, and 
cartilage, and arise from immature egg cells in the ovary. Because of the strange 
assortment of tissue types in the tumor (Figure 8-17), this tumor often is called a 
benign cystic teratoma (terat/o = monster) or a mature teratoma. Surgical 
removal of the cyst cures the condition. Cysts are bilateral 15% of the time. 
Fallopian Tubes 
pelvic inflammatory disease 
(PID) 
Inflammation and infection of organs in the pelvic region; salpingitis, 
oophoritis, endometritis, endocervicitis. 

8 
The leading causes of PID are sexually transmitted diseases 


(STDs). 
Repetitive episodes of these infections lead to formation of adhesions and scarring 
within the fallopian tubes. After PID, women have an increased risk of ectopic 
pregnancy and infertility. Signs and symptoms include fever, vaginal discharge, 
abdominal pain in the left and right lower quadrants (LLQ and RLQ), and 
tenderness to palpation (examining by touch) of the cervix. Antibiotics treat PID. 

Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) or Infections (STIs) 

Examples of bacterial and viral STDs in women are: 

. gonorrhea (gonococcal bacteria) 
. chlamydial infection (chlamydial bacteria) 
. syphilis (spirochete bacteria) 
. genital herpes (herpes simplex virus - HSV) 
. HPV infection and genital warts (human papillomavirus)

carcinoma of the breast Malignant tumor of the breast (arising from milk glands and ducts). 
(breast cancer) The most common type of breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma. Figure 
8-18A shows the tumor on a mammogram. Figure 8-18B shows a cut section of an 
invasive ductal carcinoma. Other histopathologic (histo- means tissue) types are 
lobular and medullary carcinoma of the breast. 
Breast cancer spreads first to lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit) adjacent to the 
affected breast and then to the skin and chest wall. From the lymph nodes it also 
may metastasize to other body organs, including bone, liver, lung, and brain. The 
diagnosis is first established by biopsy, either needle aspiration, or surgical 
removal of the specimen. A stereotactic core needle biopsy uses mammography 
to guide a biopsy needle into an area of concern. See the “In Person” account of 
stereotactic needle core biopsy on page 291. 
For small primary tumors, the lump with immediately surrounding tissue can 
be removed (lumpectomy). To determine whether the tumor has spread to lymph 
nodes, a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is performed. For this procedure, a blue dye 
or a radioisotope is injected into the tumor site and tracks to the axillary 
(underarm) lymph nodes. See Figure 8-19. After lumpectomy, radiation therapy to 
the breast and to any involved lymph nodes then follows, to kill remaining tumor 
cells. 
An alternative surgical procedure is mastectomy (Figure 8-20A), which is 
removal of the breast. After either lumpectomy or mastectomy if lymph nodes are 
involved with cancer, adjuvant (aiding) chemotherapy is given to prevent 
recurrence of the tumor. Breast reconstruction is an option after mastectomy. See 
Figure 8-20B. 
After surgery, further treatment may be indicated to prevent recurrence. To 
determine which treatment is best, it is important to test the breast cancer tumor 
for the presence of estrogen receptors (ERs). These receptor proteins indicate 
that the tumor will respond to hormonal therapy. If metastases should subsequently 
develop, this information will be valuable in selecting further treatment. There are 
two types of drugs that block the effects of estrogen and thereby kill ER-positive

spread. 

breast cancer cells. Drugs of the first type directly block the ER reception. An 
example is tamoxifen. Drugs of the second type block the production of estrogen 
by inhibiting the enzyme, aromatase. These aromatase inhibitors are particularly 
useful in treating postmenopausal women. Examples are anastrozole (Arimidex) 
and letrozole (Femara). 

A second receptor protein, her-2/neu, is found in some breast cancers and 
signals a high risk of tumor recurrence. Herceptin, an antibody that binds to and 
blocks her-2/neu, is effective in stopping growth when used with chemotherapy. 
Triple-negative tumors lack estrogen, progesterone, and her-2/neu and are highly 
aggressive. 

Testing for hereditary mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2, is advised for women 
with a strong family history of breast cancer. Some women who test positively for 
the breast cancer genes elect to have prophylactic (preventive) bilateral mastectomy 
with reconstruction, to eliminate risk of developing a new breast cancer.

fibrocystic breast disease Numerous small sacs of fluid surrounded by dense strands of fibrous 
tissue in the breast. 
Women with this common benign condition notice a nodular (lumpy) consistency 
of the breast, often associated with premenstrual tenderness and fullness. 
Mammography and surgical biopsy are often indicated to differentiate fibrocystic 
changes from carcinoma of the breast. 
PREGNANCY 
abruptio placentae Premature separation of the normally implanted placenta. 
Abruptio placentae (Latin ab, away from; ruptus, ruptured) occurs because of 
trauma, such as a fall, or may be secondary to vascular insufficiency resulting from 
hypertension or preeclampsia (see page 281). Signs and symptoms of acute 
abruption include sudden searing (burning) abdominal pain and bleeding. It is an 
obstetric emergency. 
ectopic pregnancy Implantation of the fertilized egg in any site other than the normal 
uterine location. 
The condition occurs in 15% of pregnancies, and 90% of these occur in the 
fallopian tubes (tubal pregnancy). Rupture of the ectopic implant within the 
fallopian tube can lead to massive abdominal bleeding and death. Surgeons can 
remove the implant, or treatment with medication (methotrexate) can destroy it, 
thereby preserving the fallopian tube before rupture occurs. Other sites of ectopic 
pregnancy include the ovaries and abdominal cavity; whatever the location, 
ectopic pregnancy often constitutes a surgical emergency. 
multiple gestations More than one fetus inside the uterus. 
Multiple births are increasing in the United States (often because of in vitro 
fertilization procedures; see page 287). These pregnancies are at higher risk for 
preterm delivery, growth restriction, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

preeclampsia Abnormal condition associated with pregnancy, marked by high blood 
pressure, proteinuria, edema, and headache. 
Mild preeclampsia can be managed by bed rest and close monitoring of blood 
pressure. Women with severe preeclampsia need treatment with medications such 
as magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures, and the baby is delivered as quickly as 
possible. The Greek word eklampein means to shine forth, referring to the 
convulsions and hypertension—typically with visual symptoms of flashing lights— 
that accompany the condition. Eclampsia is the final and most severe phase of 
untreated preeclampsia. It often causes seizures and even death of the mother 
and baby. 
NEONATAL 

The following terms describe conditions or symptoms that can affect the newborn. The Apgar score (Figure

color, muscle tone, and response to stimuli each are rated 0, 1, or 2. The maximum total score is 10. Infants 
with Apgar scores below 7 require special immediate medical attention such as suctioning of the airways or 
oxygen to help breathing.

hydrocephalus Accumulation of fluid in the spaces of the brain. 
In an infant, the entire head can enlarge because the bones of the skull do not 
completely fuse together at birth. Infants normally have a soft spot or fontanelle 
between the cranial bones that allows for some swelling during the birth of the 
baby. Hydrocephalus occurs because of a problem in the circulation of fluid within 
the brain and spinal cord, resulting in fluid accumulation. 
meconium aspiration 
syndrome 
Abnormal inhalation of meconium (first stool) produced by a fetus or 
newborn. 
Meconium, a thick, sticky, greenish to black substance, is actually the first stool 
of the fetus and newborn. If it is inhaled during birth, meconium can block air 
passages and cause respiratory distress as the lungs fail to expand. Meconium ileus 
is obstruction of the small intestine in the newborn caused by impaction of thick, 
dry meconium near the ileocecal valve. 
pyloric stenosis Narrowing of the opening of the stomach to the duodenum. 
Present at birth; surgical repair of the pyloric opening may be necessary. 
CLINICAL TESTS AND PROCEDURES 
CLINICAL TESTS 
Pap test (Pap smear) Microscopic examination of stained cells removed from the vagina and 
cervix. 
After inserting a vaginal speculum (instrument to hold apart the vaginal walls), 
the physician uses a small spatula to remove exfoliated (peeling and sloughing off) 
cells from the cervix and vagina (Figure 8-23). Microscopic analysis of the cell 
smear detects cervical or vaginal cellular abnormalities. 
pregnancy test Blood or urine test to detect the presence of hCG.

PROCEDURES 

X-Ray Studies 

hysterosalpingography (HSG) 
X-ray imaging of the uterus and fallopian tubes after injection of 
contrast material. 

This radiologic procedure is used to evaluate tubal patency (adequate opening) 
and uterine cavity abnormalities. 

mammography 
X-ray imaging of the breast. 

Women are advised to have a baseline mammogram at 40 years of age for later 
comparison if needed. A mammogram every year is recommended for women 
older than 40, to screen for breast cancer. Figure 8-24 illustrates mammography. 

A new method of mammography is digital tomosynthesis. In this procedure, an 
x-ray tube moves in an arc around the breast as several images are taken. These 
images are sent to a computer and clear, highly focused three-dimensional 
pictures are produced. In addition to being less painful, this procedure makes 
breast cancer easier to find in dense breast tissue. 

Ultrasound Examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 

breast ultrasound imaging Technologies using sound waves and magnetic waves to create images 
and breast MRI of breast tissue. 

These imaging techniques confirm the presence of a mass and can distinguish a 
cystic from a solid mass. MRI is very useful in detecting masses in young women 
with dense breasts or in women with a strong family history of breast cancer and 
at high risk for this condition. Breast ultrasound imaging is useful to evaluate a 
specific area of cancer on a mammogram.

pelvic ultrasonography Recording images of sound waves as they bounce off organs in the 
pelvic region. 
This technique can evaluate fetal size, fetal maturity, and organ development, as 
well as fetal and placental position. Uterine tumors and other pelvic masses, 
including abscesses, also are diagnosed by ultrasonography. Transvaginal 
ultrasound allows the radiologist a closer, sharper look at organs within the pelvis. 
The sound probe is placed in the vagina instead of over the pelvis or abdomen; 
this method is best used to evaluate fluid-filled cysts. 
Gynecologic Procedures 
aspiration Withdrawal of fluid from a cavity or sac with an instrument using 
suction. 
Aspiration needle biopsy is a valuable evaluation technique for patients with breast 
disease. 
cauterization Destruction of tissue by burning. 
Destruction of abnormal tissue with chemicals (silver nitrate), or an electrically 
heated instrument. Cauterization is used to treat cervical dysplasia or cervical 
erosion. The loop electrocautery excision procedure (LEEP) (see Figure 8-26A) is 
used to further assess and often treat abnormal cervical tissue. 
colposcopy Visual examination of the vagina and cervix using a colposcope. 
A colposcope is a lighted magnifying instrument resembling a small, mounted pair 
of binoculars. Gynecologists prefer colposcopy for pelvic examination when 
cervical dysplasia is present because it identifies the specific areas of abnormal 
cells. A biopsy specimen can then be taken for more accurate diagnosis (Figure 
8-25). 
conization Removal of a cone-shaped section (cone biopsy) of the cervix. 
The physician resects the tissue using a LEEP (loop electrocautery excision 
procedure), or with a carbon dioxide laser or surgical knife (scalpel). Figure 8-26A 
shows conization with LEEP, and Figure 8-26B shows the cone biopsy specimen 
removed surgically. 
cryosurgery Use of cold temperatures to destroy tissue. 
A liquid nitrogen probe produces the freezing (cry/o means cold) temperature. 
Also called cryocauterization. 
Colposcope 
FIGURE 8-25 Colposcopy is used to evaluate a 
patient with an abnormal Pap test. For this 
examination, the woman lies in the dorsal 
lithotomy position. This is the same position 
used to remove a urinary tract stone (lithotomy 
means incision to remove a stone).

dilation (dilatation) and Widening the cervix and scraping off the endometrial lining of the 
curettage (D&C) uterus. 

Dilation is accomplished by inserting a series of dilators of increasing diameter. A 
curet (metal loop at the end of a long, thin handle) is then used to sample the 8 
uterine lining. This procedure helps diagnose uterine disease and can temporarily 
halt prolonged or heavy uterine bleeding. When necessary, a D&C is used to 
remove the tissue during a spontaneous or therapeutic abortion (Figure 8-27).

exenteration Removal of internal organs within a cavity. 
Pelvic exenteration is removal of the organs and adjacent structures of the pelvis. 
laparoscopy Visual examination of the abdominal cavity using an endoscope 
(laparoscope). 
In this procedure, a form of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), small incisions 
(5 to 10 mm long) are made near the woman’s navel for introduction of the 
laparoscope and other instruments. Uses of laparoscopy include inspection and 
removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis, 
and removal of fibroids. Laparoscopy also is used to perform subtotal (cervix is left 
in place) and total hysterectomies (Figure 8-28). 
tubal ligation Blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent fertilization from occurring. 
This sterilization procedure (making an individual incapable of reproduction) is 
performed using laparoscopy or through a hysteroscope inserted via the cervical 
os (opening). Ligation means tying off and does not pertain solely to the fallopian 
tubes—which may be “tied” using clips or bands, or by surgically cutting or 
burning through the tissue. 

Procedures Related to Pregnancy 

abortion (AB) Termination of pregnancy before the embryo or fetus can exist on its 

own. 
Abortions are spontaneous or induced. Spontaneous abortions, commonly called 
“miscarriages,” occur without apparent cause. Induced abortions can be therapeutic 
or elective. A therapeutic abortion is performed when the health of the pregnant 
woman is endangered. An elective abortion is performed at the request of the 
woman. Major methods for abortion include vaginal evacuation by D&C or 
vacuum aspiration (suction) and stimulation of uterine contractions by injection 
of saline (salt solution) into the amniotic cavity (in second-trimester pregnancies).

FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 287 


amniocentesis Needle puncture of the amniotic sac to withdraw amniotic fluid for 
analysis (Figure 8-29). 
The cells of the fetus, found in the fluid, are cultured (grown), and cytologic and 
biochemical studies are performed to check fetal chromosomes, concentrations of 
proteins and bilirubin, and fetal maturation. 
cesarean section Surgical incision of the abdominal wall and uterus to deliver a fetus. 
Indications for cesarean section include cephalopelvic disproportion (the baby’s 
head is too big for the mother’s birth canal), abruptio placentae or placenta previa, 
fetal distress (fetal hypoxia), and breech or shoulder presentation. The name 
comes from a law during the time of Julius Caesar requiring removal of a fetus 
before a deceased pregnant woman could be buried. 
chorionic villus sampling 
(CVS) 
Sampling of placental tissues (chorionic villi) for prenatal diagnosis. 
The sample of tissue is removed with a catheter inserted into the uterus. The 
procedure can be performed earlier than amniocentesis, at about 9 to 12 weeks of 
gestation. 
fetal monitoring Continuous recording of the fetal heart rate and maternal uterine 
contractions to assess fetal status and the progress of labor. 
in vitro fertilization (IVF) Egg and sperm cells are combined outside the body in a laboratory dish 
(in vitro) to facilitate fertilization. 
After an incubation period of 48 to 72 hours, the fertilized ova are injected into the 
uterus through the cervix. (Latin in vitro means in glass, as used for laboratory 
containers.) From 30% to 50% of all IVF procedures are now associated with 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This is the direct injection of sperm into 
harvested ova. 
pelvimetry Measurement of the dimensions of the maternal pelvis. 
Pelvimetry helps determine if the mother’s pelvis will allow passage of the fetus 
through the birth canal. This examination is important during protracted labor or 
with breech presentation.

FIGURE 8-29 Amniocentesis. The obstetrician places a long needle through the pregnant woman’s 
abdominal wall into the amniotic cavity. Needle placement (avoiding the fetus and the placenta) is guided 
by concurrent ultrasound imaging, performed using the transducer in the radiologist’s hand. The yellow 
amniotic fluid is aspirated into the syringe attached to the needle. This procedure took place in the 16th week 
of pregnancy. The indication for the amniocentesis was a low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. This suggested a 
higher risk of Down syndrome in the baby. Karyotype analysis (received 10 days later) showed normal 
chromosome configuration.

Operation performed: Dilation and curettage of the uterus 
With the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position [legs are flexed on the thighs, thighs flexed on the 
abdomen and abducted] and sterilely prepped and draped, manual examination of the uterus revealed it to 
be 6- to 8-week size, retroflexed; no adnexal masses noted. The anterior lip of the cervix was then grasped 
with a tenaculum [a hook-like surgical instrument for grasping and holding parts]. The cervix was dilated 
up to a #20 Hank’s dilator. The uterus was sounded [depth measured] up to 4 inches. A sharp curettage of 
the endocervix showed only a scant amount of tissue. With a sharp curet, the uterus was curetted in a 
clockwise fashion with an irregularity noted in the posterior floor. A large amount of endometrial tissue 
was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

IN PERSON 


This first-person narrative describes a woman experiencing a 
stereotactic needle biopsy. 

MARY BRAUN: STEREOTACTIC NEEDLE BIOPSY 

After three mammograms and one ultrasound all performed within 
13 months, I was told that I needed to have a stereotactic biopsy. The 
mammograms and ultrasounds showed calcifications in my breast that 
were suspicious. Once you get that letter in the mail with the horrible 
word, “suspicious,” all sorts of negative thoughts begin to seep into your 
brain. With a family history of breast cancer (my mother died from it at 
age 50), I was extremely anxious to get this done right away. 

As I arrived at the hospital, full of trepidation, I reminded myself of a saying I had read many years ago. It 
went something like this: “In my life I have known many troubles, most of them never realized.” And, with 
that thought in mind, I walked into the procedure room wearing my lovely orange gown that never seems to 
tie easily. 

The technician was extremely nice and began a long recital of all the procedures that were to follow. (As they 
say, sometimes ignorance is bliss.) First, they applied a numbing substance to the exterior of my breast, and 
then injected lidocaine as a local anesthetic. After taking some additional x-ray views, they placed me on the 
table, face down. The appropriate breast was positioned downward into a chamber so that the radiologist could 
make a small incision and insert the needle to take samples. 

This is a vacuum-assisted biopsy taken using a vacuum-powered instrument to collect multiple tissue 
samples during one needle insertion. A small titanium marker was left in my breast. (In case of a negative 
prognosis, the titanium marker serves as a beacon for the surgeon who will remove cancerous tissue in 
the area.) 

The radiologist was very nice, making some small talk with me, and telling me that if anything hurt too 
much, he would stop. I could tell he was a very kind soul and resigned myself to getting through the next hour. 
Apart from mild discomfort of the lidocaine injection, the rest of the procedure was relatively pain free. I think 
that one of the hard parts for patients is trying to lie as still as possible for 30-40 minutes. After they were 
satisfied that the samples were sufficient, the needle was removed and another technician came to apply 
pressure to the area for about 10 minutes. 

An antiseptic, gauze, and bandage were applied to the wound and instructions given on how to proceed for 
the next few days. After 24 hours, I was permitted to shower and could change the gauze and bandage. For a 
day or two, no strenuous exercise was allowed. An additional mammogram was taken before I left the hospital 
and I was given an ice pack for my breast. 

The worst part of this procedure was the anticipation. Who wants to be lying on a table with your boob 
hanging through a small hole waiting to be punctured with a metal object? To all the women who are reading 
this and wondering what it will be like, take my word for it, get it done, the worst part is in your head 
anticipating it.

1. Dr. Hanson felt that it was important to do a (culdocentesis, Pap test, amniocentesis) once yearly 
on each of her GYN patients to screen for abnormal cells. 
2. When Doris missed her period, her doctor checked for the presence of (LH, IUD, hCG) in Doris’s 
urine to see if she was pregnant. 
3. Ellen was 34 weeks pregnant and experiencing bad headaches and blurry vision, with a 10-pound 
weight gain in 2 days. Dr. Murphy told her to go to the obstetric emergency department because 
she suspected (preeclampsia, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroids). 
4. Fifty-two-year-old Sally noticed increasing pain, fullness, and swelling in her abdomen. She had a 
history of ovarian cancer, so her physician recommended (sentinel node biopsy, pelvic 
ultrasonography, colposcopy).

5. 
Clara knew that she should not ignore her fevers and yellow vaginal discharge and the pain in her 
side. She had previous episodes of (PMS, PID, HRT) treated with IV antibiotics. She worried that 
she might have a recurrence. 
6. 
After years of trying to become pregnant, Jill decided to speak to her (hematologist, gynecologist, 
urologist) about in vitro (gestation, parturition, fertilization). 
7. 
To harvest her ova, Jill’s physician prescribed hormones to stimulate egg maturation andT 
TT (coitus, 
lactation, ovulation). Ova were surgically removed and fertilized with sperm cells in a Petri dish. 
8. 
Next, multiple embryos were implanted into Jill’s (fallopian tube, vagina, uterus), and she received 
hormones to ensure the survival of at least one embryo. 
9. 
The IVF was successful and after (abdominal CT, ultrasound examination, pelvimetry), Jill was 
told that she would have twins in 8. months. 
10. At 37 weeks, Jill went into labor. Under continuous (chorionic villus sampling, culdocentesis, fetal 
monitoring), two healthy infants were delivered vaginally. 
11. At age 41, Carol had a screening (hysterosalpingogram, mammogram, conization) of her breasts. 
The results showed tiny calcium deposits or calcifications, behind her (areola, chorion, adnexae 
uteri). A core needle (laparoscopy, colposcopy, biopsy) was performed and showed cells that 
were an early sign of cancer called (CIN, DCIS, DUB). Her surgical oncologist recommended 
(lumpectomy, TAH-BSO, chorionic villus sampling) to remove the calcifications and surrounding 
tissue as treatment.

312 MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 
9 
INTRODUCTION 
The male sex cell, the spermatozoon (sperm cell), is microscopic—in volume, only one 
third the size of a red blood cell and less than 1/100,000 the size of the female ovum. A 
relatively uncomplicated cell, the sperm is composed of a head region, containing nuclear 
hereditary material (chromosomes), and a tail region, consisting of a flagellum (hair-like 
process). The flagellum makes the sperm motile and makes it look somewhat like a tadpole. 
The spermatozoon cell contains relatively little food and cytoplasm, because it lives only 
long enough (3 to 5 days) to travel from its point of release from the male to where the egg 
cell lies within the female reproductive tract (fallopian tube). Only one spermatozoon out 
of approximately 300 million sperm cells released during a single ejaculation (ejection of 
sperm and fluid from the male urethra) can penetrate a single ovum and result in fertilization 
of the ovum. Figure 9-1 shows a diagram of a sperm cell and a photograph of spermatozoa. 
If more than one egg is passing down the fallopian tube when sperm are present, multiple 
fertilizations are possible, and twins, triplets, quadruplets, and so on may occur. Twins 
resulting from the fertilization of separate ova by separate sperm cells are called fraternal 
twins. Fraternal twins, developing with separate placentas, can be of the same sex or 
different sexes and resemble each other no more than ordinary brothers and sisters. 
Fraternal twinning is hereditary; the daughters of mothers of twins can carry the gene. 
Identical twins result from fertilization of a single egg cell by a single sperm. As the 
fertilized egg cell divides and forms many cells, it somehow splits, and each part continues 
separately to undergo further division, each producing an embryo. Most identical twins 
have one placenta and two amniotic sacs. Identical twins are always of the same sex and are 
very similar in form and feature. 
The organs of the male reproductive system are designed to produce and release billions 
of spermatozoa throughout the lifetime of a male from puberty onward. In addition, 
the male reproductive system secretes a hormone called testosterone. Testosterone is 
responsible for the production of the bodily characteristics of the male (such as beard, 
pubic hair, and deeper voice) and for the proper development of male gonads (testes) and 
accessory organs (prostate gland and seminal vesicles) that secrete fluids to ensure the 
lubrication and viability of sperm.

ANATOMY 
Label Figure 9-2 as you study the following description of the anatomy of the male 
reproductive system. 
Each male gonad is a testis [1]. There are two testes (plural) or testicles that develop in 
the abdomen at about the level of the kidneys before descending during embryonic 
development into the scrotum [2], a sac enclosing the testes on the outside of the body. 
The scrotum, lying between the thighs, exposes the testes to a lower temperature than 
that of the rest of the body. This lower temperature is necessary for the adequate maturation 
and development of sperm (spermatogenesis). Located between the anus and the scrotum, 
at the floor of the pelvic cavity in the male, the perineum [3] is analogous to the perineal 
region in the female. 
The interior of a testis is composed of a large mass of narrow, coiled tubules called the 
seminiferous tubules [4]. These tubules contain cells that manufacture spermatozoa. 
The seminiferous tubules are the parenchymal tissue of the testis, which means that they 
perform the essential work of the organ (formation of sperm). Other cells in the testis, lying 
adjacent to seminiferous tubules, are interstitial cells. They manufacture an important 
male hormone, testosterone. 
All body organs contain parenchyma, which perform the essential functions of the organ. 
Organs also contain supportive, connective, and framework tissue, such as blood vessels, 
connective tissues, and sometimes muscle as well. This supportive tissue is called stroma 
(stromal tissue). 
After formation, sperm cells move through the seminiferous tubules and collect in ducts 
that lead to a large tube, the epididymis [5], at the upper part of each testis. The spermatozoa

mature, become motile in the epididymis, and are temporarily stored there. An epididymis 
runs down the length of each testicle (the coiled tube is about 16 feet long) and then turns 
upward again and becomes a narrow, straight tube called the vas deferens [6] or ductus 
deferens. Figure 9-3 shows the internal structure of a testis and the epididymis. The vas 
deferens is about 2 feet long and carries the sperm up into the pelvic region, at the level of 
the urinary bladder, merging with ducts from the seminal vesicles [7] to form the ejaculatory 
duct [8] leading toward the urethra. During a vasectomy or sterilization procedure, the 
urologist cuts and ties off each vas deferens by making an incision in the scrotum. 
The seminal vesicles, two glands (only one is shown in Figure 9-2) located at the base of 
the bladder, open into the ejaculatory duct as it joins the urethra [9]. They secrete a thick, 
sugary, yellowish substance that nourishes the sperm cells and forms a portion of ejaculated 
semen. Semen, a combination of fluid (seminal fluid) and spermatozoa (sperm cells account 
for less than 1% of the semen volume), is ejected from the body through the urethra. In the 
male, as opposed to that in the female, the genital orifice combines with the urinary 
(urethral) opening. 
The prostate gland [10] lies at the region where the vas deferens enters the urethra, 
almost encircling the upper end of the urethra. It secretes a thick fluid that, as part of 
semen, aids the motility of the sperm. The muscular tissue of the prostate aids in the 
expulsion of fluid during ejaculation. About 60% of ejaculate comes from seminal vesicles 
and 40% from the prostate. Bulbourethral glands [11], lying below the prostate gland, also 
secrete fluid into the urethra. 
The urethra passes through the penis [12] to the outside of the body. The penis is 
composed of erectile tissue and at its tip expands to form a soft, sensitive region called the 
glans penis [13]. Ordinarily, a fold of skin called the prepuce, or foreskin [14], covers the 
glans penis. During a circumcision the foreskin is removed, leaving the glans penis visible 
at all times. 
Erectile dysfunction (impotence) is the inability of the adult male to achieve an erection. 
Viagra (sildenafil), Cialis (tadalafil), and Levitra (vardenafil) are drugs that increase blood 
flow to the penis, enhancing ability to have an erection. 
The flow diagram in Figure 9-4 traces the path of spermatozoa from their formation in 
the seminiferous tubules of the testes to the outside of the body.

TUMORS AND ANATOMIC/STRUCTURAL DISORDERS 

Testes 

carcinoma of the testes 
Malignant tumor of the testicles. 

(testicular cancer) 
Testicular tumors are rare except in the 15- to 35-year-old age group. The most 
common tumor, a seminoma, arises from embryonic cells in the testes (Figure 
9-7A). Nonseminomatous tumors are embryonal carcinoma (Figure 9-7B), 
teratoma, choriocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumor. Teratomas are composed of 
tissue such as bone, hair, cartilage, and skin cells (terat/o means monster).

Seminoma 

FIGURE 9-7 A, Seminoma of a testis. 
B, Embryonal carcinoma of a testis. In 
contrast with the seminoma, which is a pale, 
homogeneous mass, the embryonal 
carcinoma is a hemorrhagic mass. 


A B 
Azoospermia/Aspermia 

Azoospermia is semen without sperm cells while aspermia is no semen at all. 



320 MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 


If detected early, testicular cancers 


can be treated and cured with surgery 
(orchiectomy), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Tumors produce the proteins 
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Serum levels 
of these proteins are used as tumor markers to determine success of treatment. 
cryptorchidism; cryptorchism 
Undescended testicles. 

Orchiopexy is performed to bring the testes into the scrotum, if they do not descend 
on their own by the age of 1 or 2 years. Undescended testicles are associated with 
a high risk for sterility and increased risk of developing testicular cancer. 

hydrocele 
Sac of clear fluid in the scrotum. 

Hydroceles (Figure 9-8) may be congenital or occur as a response to infection or 
tumors. Often idiopathic, they can be differentiated from testicular masses by 
ultrasound imaging. If the hydrocele does not resolve on its own, the sac fluid is 
aspirated using a needle and syringe, or hydrocelectomy may be necessary. In this 
procedure, the sac is surgically removed through an incision in the scrotum. 

testicular torsion 
Twisting of the spermatic cord (see Figure 9-8). 
The rotation of the spermatic cord cuts off blood supply to the testis. Torsion 
occurs most frequently in childhood. Surgical correction within hours of onset of 
symptoms can save the testis. 

varicocele 
Enlarged, dilated veins near the testicle. 

Varicocele (see Figure 9-8) may be associated with oligospermia and azoospermia. 
Oligospermic men with varicocele and scrotal pain should have a varicocelectomy. 
In this procedure, the internal spermatic vein is ligated (the affected segment is 
cut out and the ends are tied off). On occasion, this leads to an increase in fertility.

Testicular Cancer Detection 

There may be no signs or symptoms of testicular cancer. Regular testicular self-examinations, however, can help identify 
growths earlier, when the chance for successful treatment is highest. A man should see a doctor if he detects any mass, pain, or 
swelling in his scrotum.

Prostate Gland 
benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH) 
Benign growth of cells within the prostate gland. 
BPH is a common condition in men older than 60 years of age. Urinary obstruction 
and inability to empty the bladder completely are symptoms. Figure 9-9 shows the 
prostate gland with BPH and with carcinoma. Surgical treatment by transurethral 
resection of the prostate (TURP) relieves the obstruction, but overgrowth of cells 
may recur over several years. In this procedure, an endoscope (resectoscope) is 
inserted into the penis and through the urethra. Prostatic tissue is removed by an 
electrical hot loop attached to the resectoscope (see page 325). 
Several drugs to relieve BPH symptoms have been approved by the FDA. 
Finasteride (Proscar) inhibits production of a potent testosterone that promotes 
enlargement of the prostate. Other drugs, alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin 
(Flomax), act by relaxing the smooth muscle of the prostate and the neck of the 
bladder. 
Lasers also may be used to destroy prostatic tissue and relieve obstruction. A 
laser TURP or GreenLight PVP procedure uses a green light laser at the end of an 
endoscope (see page 325). 
carcinoma of the prostate 
(prostate cancer) 
Malignant tumor (adenocarcinoma) of the prostate gland. 
This cancer commonly occurs in men who are older than 50 years. Digital rectal 
examination (DRE) (Figure 9-10) can detect the tumor at a later stage, but early 
detection depends on a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. PSA is a protein that 
is secreted by tumor cells into the bloodstream. PSA levels are elevated in prostate 
cancer patients even at an early stage of tumor growth. The normal PSA level is 
4.0 ng/mL or less.

they can be palpated on digital rectal exam (DRE).

Diagnosis requires identification by a pathologist of abnormal prostate tissue in 
a prostate biopsy. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guides the precise placement of 
the biopsy needle. Multiple needle biopsy specimens are taken through the rectal 
wall. Computed tomography (CT) detects lymph node metastases. 

Treatment consists of surgery (prostatectomy), radiation therapy, and/or 
hormonal chemotherapy. Because prostatic cells are stimulated to grow in the 
presence of androgens, antiandrogen hormones slow tumor growth by depriving 
the cells of testosterone. Prostate cancer also is treated with leupron, a hormone 
that blocks pituitary stimulation of the testes and reduces the level of androgens 
in the bloodstream. Tumor cells can also be destroyed by brachytherapy (brachy = 
near), which means that radioactive seeds are implanted directly into the prostate 
gland. See the “In Person” account, page 329, describing one man’s experience 
with prostate cancer. 

Penis 

hypospadias 
Congenital abnormality in which the male urethral opening is on the 
undersurface of the penis, instead of at its tip. 

Hypospadias (-spadias means the condition of tearing or cutting) occurs in 1 in 
every 300 live male births and can be corrected surgically (Figure 9-11A). 

phimosis 
Narrowing (stricture) of the opening of the prepuce over the glans 
penis. 

This condition (phim/o = muzzle) can interfere with urination and cause 
secretions to accumulate under the prepuce, leading to infection. Treatment is by 
circumcision (cutting around the prepuce to remove it) (Figure 9-11B). 

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES 

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections transmitted by sexual or other genital contact. Also 
known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and venereal diseases (from Latin Venus, the goddess of 
love), they occur in both men and women and are some of the most prevalent communicable diseases in the 
world. 

chlamydial infection 
Bacterial invasion (by Chlamydia trachomatis) of the urethra and 
reproductive tract. 

Within 3 weeks after becoming infected, men may experience a burning sensation 
on urination and notice a white or clear discharge from the penis. 

Infected women may notice a yellowish vaginal discharge (from the endocervix), 
but often the disease is asymptomatic. Antibiotics cure the infection, but if 
untreated, this STD can cause salpingitis (pelvic inflammatory disease [PID]) and 
infertility in women. 

gonorrhea 
Inflammation of the genital tract mucosa, caused by infection with 
gonococci (berry-shaped bacteria). 

Other areas of the body, such as the eye, oral mucosa, rectum, and joints, may be 
affected as well. Signs and symptoms include dysuria and a yellow, mucopurulent 
(purulent means pus-filled) discharge from the male urethra (Figure 9-12A). The 
ancient Greeks mistakenly thought that this discharge was a leakage of semen, so 
they named the condition gonorrhea, meaning discharge of seed (gon/o = seed). 

Many women carry the disease asymptomatically, whereas others have pain, 
vaginal and urethral discharge, and salpingitis (PID). As a result of sexual activity, 
men and women can acquire anorectal and pharyngeal gonococcal infections as 
well. Chlamydial infection and gonorrhea often occur together. When treating 
these infections, doctors give antibiotics for both and treat both partners.

tissue or using a graft from tissue elsewhere in the body and bringing it to the exit at the tip of the penis. 
B, Phimosis and circumcision to correct the condition. 

herpes genitalis 
Infection of skin and genital mucosa, caused by the herpes simplex 
virus (HSV). 

Most cases of herpes genitalis are caused by HSV type 2 (although some are caused 
by HSV type 1, which commonly is associated with oral infections such as cold 
sores or fever blisters). The usual clinical presentation is reddening of skin with 
formation of small, fluid-filled blisters and ulcers (Figure 9-12B). Initial episodes 
also may involve inguinal lymphadenopathy, fever, headache, and malaise. 
Remissions and relapse periods occur; no drug is known to be effective as a cure. 
Neonatal herpes affects infants born to women with active infection near the time 
of delivery. Gynecologists may deliver infants by cesarean section to prevent 
infection of these babies by HSV. Studies suggest that women with herpes genitalis 
are at a higher risk for developing vulvar and cervical cancer.

Some types of HPV cause genital warts (see Figure 9-13A) and lead to cancer of 
the cervix as well as cancer in men. A vaccine is available for young girls and 
women (and under evaluation for men) that protects against four types of HPV. 
syphilis Chronic STD caused by a spirochete (spiral-shaped bacterium). 
A chancre (hard ulcer or sore) usually appears on the external genitalia a few 
weeks after bacterial infection (Figure 9-13B). Two to six months after the chancre 
disappears, secondary syphilis begins. Tertiary syphilis includes damage to the 
brain, spinal cord, and heart, which may appear years after the earlier symptoms 
disappear. Syphilis (which was so often fatal in early times that it was known as 
the “great pox”—versus the more familiar smallpox) can be congenital in the fetus 
if it is transmitted from the mother during pregnancy. Penicillin is effective for 
treatment in most cases. 

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

LABORATORY TESTS 

PSA test Measurement of levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. 

PSA is produced by cells within the prostate gland. Elevated levels of PSA are 
associated with enlargement of the prostate gland and may be a sign of prostate 
cancer. 

semen analysis Microscopic examination of ejaculated fluid. 

Sperm cells are counted and examined for motility and shape. The test is part of 
fertility studies and is required to establish the effectiveness of vasectomy. Men 
with sperm counts of less than 20 million/mL of semen usually are sterile (not 
fertile). Sterility can result in an adult male who becomes ill with mumps, an 
infectious disease affecting the testes (inflammation leads to deterioration of 
spermatozoa). 



MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 325 


CLINICAL PROCEDURES 
castration Surgical excision of testicles or ovaries. 
Castration may be performed to reduce production and secretion of hormones 
that stimulate growth of malignant cells (in breast cancer and prostate cancer). 
When a boy is castrated before puberty, he becomes a eunuch (Greek, eune, couch; 
echein, to guard). Male secondary sex characteristics fail to develop.

of BPH. 
transurethral resection of the 
prostate (TURP) 
Excision of benign prostatic hyperplasia using a resectoscope through 
the urethra. 
This procedure treats benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). An electrical hot loop 
cuts the prostatic tissue; the bits of tissue (chips) are removed through the 
resectoscope (Figure 9-14).

procedure is performed using local anesthesia and through an incision in the 
scrotal sac. Because spermatozoa cannot leave the body, the vasectomized male is 
sterile, but not castrated. Normal hormone secretion, sex drive, and potency 
(ability to have an erection) are intact. The body reabsorbs unexpelled sperm. In a 
small number of cases, a vasovasostomy can successfully reverse vasectomy.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
Reproduced here from actual medical records is a case report on a patient with post-TURP complaints. 
Background data and explanations of more difficult terms are added in brackets. Answers to the questions 
are on page 337. 

Also presented for your review is an actual surgical pathology report for a man diagnosed with prostate 
cancer, as well as a summary of current knowledge on anabolic steroids. 

CASE REPORT: A MAN WITH POST-TURP COMPLAINTS 

The patient is a 70-year-old man who underwent a TURP for BPH 5 years ago and now has severe obstructive 
urinary symptoms with a large postvoid residual. 

On DRE, his prostate was found to be large, bulky, and nodular, with palpable extension to the left 
seminal vesicle. His PSA level was 15 ng/mL [normal is 0 to 4 ng/mL] and a bone scan was negative. A 
CT scan revealed bilateral external iliac adenopathy with lymph nodes measuring 1.5 cm on average 
[normal lymph node size is less than 1 cm]. A prostatic biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma. 

This patient most likely has at least stage T3 N+ disease [extension into seminal vesicles and nodal 
metastases]. Recommendation is anti-testosterone hormonal drug treatment.

BENIGN HYPERPLASIA 
ABOUT ANABOLIC STEROIDS 

Anabolic steroids are male hormones (androgens) that increase body weight and muscle size and may be 
used by doctors to increase growth in boys who do not mature physically as expected for their age. Steroids 
also may be used by athletes in an effort to increase strength and enhance performance; however, significant 
detrimental side effects of these drugs have been recognized: 

. High levels of anabolic steroids cause acne, hepatic tumors, and sterility (testicular atrophy and 
oligospermia). 
. In women, the androgenic effect of anabolic steroids leads to male hair distribution, deepening of the 
voice, amenorrhea, and clitoral enlargement. 
. Anabolic steroid use also causes hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, jaundice (liver abnormalities), 
and salt and water retention (edema). 
Gleason Score 

The Gleason score (named after Dr. Donald Gleason, a pathologist who developed it in the 1960s) is based on the microscopic 
appearance of the prostate biopsy specimen. Cancers with a higher Gleason score are more aggressive and carry a worse 
prognosis. The pathologist assigns a grade (number) to the most common tumor cells and another to the next most common 
tumor cells. Adding these numbers together gives the Gleason score. The score is based on a scale from 1 to 5. More 
well-differentiated (closer to normal) cells are given a lower grade, and poorly differentiated (malignant) cells are given a higher 
grade.

IN PERSON 


This is a first-person narrative of a man diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. 

As with many men in their late 50s, the PSA prostate-related lab 
test was the first item I would always look at when having my 
annual physical. Over a few years, the PSA had been going up 
gradually, but nothing that seemed to indicate anything unusual. 
So it was a bit of a surprise when my primary care doctor 
suggested that it might be time to have a further medical review 
of the slowly increasing results. The PSA was 4.37 (4.0 or less is 
considered normal). 

Being in good overall health, I expected the follow-up prostate 
exam and biopsy to be of a routine nature. It was with great 
surprise that the prostate biopsy showed that 3 of 12 samples were positive for cancerous cells. My Gleason 
score was 6 (3 + 3). This situation was described to me as favorable, an early-stage cancer. Nevertheless, I had 
no idea of the treatment options available. 

I decided that the best way to reach a decision for a treatment plan was to get together with the doctors at 
the Mass General Cancer Center in the genitourinary area, have my situation reviewed and to learn more 
about my options. I realized that the possibilities ranged widely, including watchful waiting, external radiation, 
internal radiation, and prostate surgery (prostatectomy). In the end, the decision becomes your own in 
early-stage prostate cancer, and that, in itself, can leave you second guessing the choice numerous times. 

After careful thought and review of the information with my physicians and family, I decided to pursue the 
internal radiation option, or brachytherapy, often referred to as implantation of radiation seeds. Even up to the 
time of the procedure, the question remained with me as to whether I was making the right choice: should I 
wait a while and just see how things go, and would there be any of the unlikely side effects that are noted for 
this procedure? When the time came, I decided to go forward and had the procedure done at MGH. The entire 
medical team there made the process from start to completion as successful an event as one could hope for. 
The best news was that after the procedure, my PSA dropped to 2.5. 

Now a year has passed, and I am happy to see that the PSA has continued downward. The long-term side 
effects of the brachytherapy procedure were related to urination and erectile dysfunction. While urination 
post-procedure was painful, discomfort dissipated within a week or so. Long term, managing the control of 
urination was an issue, but after a year it has definitely improved. Erectile dysfunction after any type of 
prostate procedure is an issue. I found it to be a major effect early on, but less as time progressed. There is still 
the required monitoring and checkups needed to see that nothing further develops from here on, but taking 
warning signs seriously, educating yourself, and making an informed decision with the help of the best medical 
team possible will make you feel good about your choices.

6. After his fifth child was born, Art decided to have a (vasovasostomy, hydrocelectomy, vasectomy) 
to prevent conception of another child. A/an (nephrologist, urologist, abdominal surgeon) 
performed the procedure to cut and ligate the (urethra, epididymis, vas deferens) . 
7. 
TT
TTwenty-six-year-old Lance noticed a hard testicular mass. His physician prescribed a brief trial with 
(antibodies, antibiotics, pain killers) to rule out (epididymitis, testicular cancer, varicocele) . The 
mass remained and Lance underwent (epididymectomy, orchiectomy, prostatectomy) . The mass 
was a (seminoma, prostate cancer, hydrocele) . 
8. Sarah and Steve had been trying to conceive a child for 7 years. Steve had a (digital rectal 
examination, TURP, semen analysis), which revealed 25% normal sperm count with 10% motility. 
He was told he had (phimosis, azoospermia, oligospermia) . 
9. 
To boost his sperm count, Steve was givenT 
TT (estrogen, testosterone, progesterone) . As a side effect, 
this (androgen, progestin, enzyme) gave him a case of acne lasting several months. 
10. Sarah eventually became pregnant. An ultrasound examination showed two embryos with two 
separate placentas and in separate (peritoneal, scrotal, amniotic) sacs. Sarah gave birth to two 
healthy (identical, fraternal, perineal) twin girls.

344 NERVOUS SYSTEM 


10 
INTRODUCTION 

The nervous system is one of the most complex of all human body systems. More than 100 
billion nerve cells operate constantly all over the body to coordinate the activities we do 
consciously and voluntarily, as well as those that occur unconsciously or involuntarily. We 
speak, move muscles, hear, taste, see, and think. Our glands secrete hormones, and we 
respond to danger, pain, temperature, and touch. All of these functions comprise only a 
small number of the many activities controlled by the nervous system. 

Fibers exiting from microscopic nerve cells (neurons) are collected into macroscopic 
bundles called nerves, which carry electrical messages all over the body. External stimuli, 
as well as internal chemicals such as acetylcholine, activate the cell membranes of nerve 
cells, which results in electrical discharges of these cells. These electrical discharges, 
nervous impulses, may then traverse the length of the associated nerves. External receptors 
(sense organs) as well as internal receptors in muscles and blood vessels receive these 
impulses and may in turn transmit impulses to the complex network of nerve cells in the 
brain and spinal cord. Within this central part of the nervous system, impulses are 
recognized, interpreted, and finally relayed to other nerve cells that extend out to all parts 
of the body, such as muscles, glands, and internal organs. 

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

The nervous system is classified into two major divisions: the central nervous system 
(CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system consists of 
the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of cranial nerves and 
spinal nerves, plexuses, and peripheral nerves throughout the body (Figure 10-1). Cranial 
nerves carry impulses between the brain and the head and neck. The one exception is the 
10th cranial nerve, called the vagus nerve. It carries messages to and from the neck, chest, 
and abdomen. Figure 10-2 shows cranial nerves, their functions, and the parts of the body 
that they carry messages to and from. Spinal nerves carry messages between the spinal cord 
and the chest, abdomen, and extremities. 

A plexus 


is a large network of nerves in the peripheral nervous system. The cervical, 
brachial (brachi/o means arm), and lumbosacral plexuses are examples that include cervical, 
lumbar, and sacral nerves. Figure 10-1 illustrates the relationship of the brain and spinal 
cord to the spinal nerves and plexuses. 
The spinal and cranial nerves are composed of nerves that help the body respond to 
changes in the outside world. They include sense receptors for sight (eye), hearing and 
balance (ear), smell (olfactory), and touch (skin sensation) and sensory (afferent) nerves 
that carry messages related to changes in the environment toward the spinal cord and 
brain. In addition, motor (efferent) nerves travel from the spinal cord and brain to muscles 
of the body, telling them how to respond. For example, when you touch a hot stove, 
temperature and pain receptors in the skin stimulate afferent nerves, which carry messages 
toward the spinal cord and brain. Instantaneously, the message is conveyed to efferent 
nerve cells in the spinal cord, which then activate voluntary muscles to pull your hand away 
from the stove.

 Plexus 


There are other plexuses in the body—networks of intersecting blood vessels (vascular) and lymphatic vessels. 

. Lymphatic plexus is an interconnecting network of lymph vessels. 
. Rectal plexus is a plexus of veins in the rectal region. 
. Vertebral plexus is a plexus of veins related to the backbone. 


NERVOUS SYSTEM 345 
10 
In addition to the spinal and cranial nerves (whose functions are mainly voluntary 
and involved with sensations of smell, taste, sight, hearing, and muscle movements), the 
peripheral nervous system also contains a large group of nerves that function involuntarily 
or automatically, without conscious control. These peripheral nerves belong to the 
autonomic nervous system. This system of nerve fibers carries impulses away from the 
CNS to the glands, heart, blood vessels, and involuntary muscles found in the walls of tubes 
like the intestines and hollow organs like the stomach and urinary bladder.

FIGURE 10-2 Cranial nerves (I to XII) leading from the base of the brain and showing the parts of the 
body they affect. Sensory or afferent nerves are colored blue and carry messages toward the brain. Motor 
or efferent nerves are colored red and carry messages from the brain to muscles and organs. Some nerves 
(mixed) carry both sensory and motor fibers. Don’t try to memorize this figure! Just get the big picture: 
Cranial nerves carry messages to and from the brain to all parts of head and neck and also (in the case of the 
vagus nerve) to other parts of the body. 

Some autonomic nerves are sympathetic nerves and others are parasympathetic nerves. 
The sympathetic nerves stimulate the body in times of stress and crisis. They increase heart 
rate and forcefulness, dilate (relax) airways so more oxygen can enter, and increase blood 
pressure. In addition, sympathetic neurons stimulate the adrenal glands to secrete 
epinephrine (adrenaline), while also inhibiting intestinal contractions to slow digestion. 
The parasympathetic nerves normally act as a balance for the sympathetic nerves.

348 NERVOUS SYSTEM 


NEURONS, NERVES, AND GLIAL CELLS 

A neuron is an individual nerve cell, a microscopic structure. Impulses pass along the parts 
of a nerve cell in a definite manner and direction. The parts of a neuron are pictured in 
Figure 10-5; label it as you study the following. 

A stimulus begins an impulse in the branching fibers of the neuron, which are called 
dendrites [1]. A change in the electrical charge of the dendrite membranes is thus begun, 
and the nervous impulse moves along the dendrites like the movement of falling dominoes. 
The impulse, traveling in only one direction, next reaches the cell body [2], which contains 
the cell nucleus [3]. Small collections of nerve cell bodies outside the brain and spinal cord 
are called ganglia (singular: ganglion). Extending from the cell body is the axon [4], which 
carries the impulse away from the cell body. Axons can be covered with a fatty tissue called 
myelin. The purpose of this myelin sheath [5] is to insulate the axon and speed transmission 
of the electrical impulse. Demyelination is loss of the myelin insulating the nerve fiber and 
is characteristic of multiple sclerosis, an acquired illness affecting the CNS. 

The myelin sheath gives a white appearance to the nerve fiber—hence the term white 
matter, as in parts of the spinal cord and the white matter of the brain and most peripheral

(essential) cells of the nervous system. The boxed drawing shows what happens in a synapse: Vesicles 
store neurotransmitters in the terminal end fibers of axons. Receptors on the dendrites pick up the 
neurotransmitters. Inactivators end the activity of neurotransmitters when they have finished their job.

nerves. The gray matter of the brain and spinal cord is composed of the cell bodies of 
neurons that appear gray because they are not covered by a myelin sheath. 
The nervous impulse passes through the axon to leave the cell via the terminal end fibers 
[6] of the neuron. The space where the nervous impulse jumps from one neuron to another 
is called the synapse [7]. The transfer of the impulse across the synapse depends on the 
release of a chemical substance, called a neurotransmitter, by the neuron that brings the 
impulse to the synapse. See the boxed diagram in Figure 10-5. Tiny sacs (vesicles) containing 
the neurotransmitter are located at the ends of neurons, and they release the neurotransmitter 
into the synapse. Acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine (adrenaline), dopamine, 
serotonin, and endorphins are examples of neurotransmitters. 
Whereas a neuron is a microscopic structure within the nervous system, a nerve is 
macroscopic, able to be seen with the naked eye. A nerve consists of a bundle of dendrites 
and axons that travel together like strands of rope. Peripheral nerves that carry impulses to 
the brain and spinal cord from stimulus receptors like the skin, eye, ear, and nose are 
afferent or sensory nerves; those that carry impulses from the CNS to organs that produce 
responses, such as muscles and glands, are efferent or motor nerves. 
Neurons and nerves are the parenchyma of the nervous system. Parenchyma is the 
essential distinguishing tissue of an organ. In the brain and spinal cord, neurons, which 
conduct electrical impulses, are the parenchymal tissue. Stroma of an organ is the 
connective and supportive tissue of an organ. The stromal tissue of the nervous system 
consists of the glial (neuroglial) cells, which make up its supportive framework and help it 
ward off infection. Glial cells do not transmit impulses. They are far more numerous than 
neurons and can reproduce. 
There are four types of supporting or glial cells (see Figure 10-6). Astrocytes (astroglial 
cells) are star-like in appearance (astr/o means star) and transport water and salts 
between capillaries and neurons. Microglial cells are small cells with many branching 
processes (dendrites). As phagocytes, they protect neurons in response to inflammation. 
Oligodendroglial cells (oligodendrocytes) have few (olig/o means few or scanty) dendrites. 
These cells form the myelin sheath in the CNS. By contrast, ependymal cells (Greek 
ependyma means upper garment) line membranes within the brain and spinal cord where 
CSF is produced and circulates. 
Glial cells, particularly the astrocytes, are associated with blood vessels and regulate the 
passage of potentially harmful substances from the blood into the nerve cells of the brain. 
This protective barrier between the blood and brain cells is called the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). This barrier consists of special lining (endothelial) cells, which along with astrocytes 
separate capillaries from nerve cells. Delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat brain 
tumors is thus difficult, because the BBB blocks drug access to brain tissues. Figure 10-6 
illustrates glial cells.

THE BRAIN 
The brain controls body activities. In the human adult, it weighs about 3 pounds and has 
many different parts, all of which control different aspects of body functions. 
The largest part of the brain is the “thinking” area, or cerebrum. On the surface of the 
cerebrum, nerve cells lie in sheets, which make up the cerebral cortex. These sheets, 
arranged in folds called gyri, are separated from each other by grooves known as sulci. The 
brain is divided in half, a right side and a left side, which are called cerebral hemispheres. 
Each hemisphere is subdivided into four major lobes named for the cranial (skull) bones 
that overlie them. Figure 10-7 shows these lobes—frontal, parietal, occipital, and 
temporal—as well as gyri and sulci. 
The cerebrum has many functions. Thought, judgment, memory, association, and 
discrimination take place within it. In addition, sensory impulses are received through 
afferent cranial nerves, and when registered in the cortex, they are the basis for perception. 
Cranial nerves carry motor impulses from the cerebrum to muscles and glands, and these 
produce movement and activity. Figure 10-7 shows the location of some of the centers in 
the cerebral cortex that control speech, vision, smell, movement, hearing, and thought 
processes. 
In the middle of the cerebrum are spaces, or canals, called ventricles (pictured in Figure 
10-8). They contain a watery fluid that flows throughout the brain and around the spinal 
cord. This fluid is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and it protects the brain and spinal cord from 
shock by acting like a cushion. CSF usually is clear and colorless and contains lymphocytes, 
sugar, and proteins. Spinal fluid can be withdrawn for diagnosis or relief of pressure on the 
brain; this is called a lumbar puncture (LP). For this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted

Notice the lobes of the cerebrum and the functional centers that control speech, vision, movement, hearing, 
thinking, and other processes. Neurologists believe that the two hemispheres have different abilities. The left 
brain is more concerned with language, mathematical functioning, reasoning, and analytical thinking. The 
right brain is more active in spatial relationships, art, music, emotions, and intuition.

into the lumbar region of the spinal column below the region where the nervous tissue of 
the spinal cord ends, and CSF is withdrawn. 
Two other important parts of the brain are the thalamus and the hypothalamus (Figure 
10-9). The thalamus acts like a triage center. It decides what is important and what is not, 
selectively processing and relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus 
also plays a major role in maintaining levels of awareness and consciousness. The 
hypothalamus (below the thalamus) contains neurons that control body temperature, 
sleep, appetite, sexual desire, and emotions such as fear and pleasure. The hypothalamus 
also regulates the release of hormones from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain and 
integrates the activities of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. 
The following structures within the brain lie in the back and below the cerebrum and 
connect the cerebrum with the spinal cord: cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. The 
pons and medulla are part of the brainstem. 
The cerebellum functions to coordinate voluntary movements and to maintain balance 
and posture. 
The pons is a part of the brainstem that literally means bridge. It contains nerve fiber 
tracts that connect the cerebellum and cerebrum with the rest of the brain. Nerves to the 
eyes and face lie here. 
The medulla oblongata, also in the brainstem, connects the spinal cord with the rest of 
the brain. Nerve tracts cross from right to left and left to right in the medulla oblongata. 
For example, nerve cells that control movement of the left side of the body are found in the 
right half of the cerebrum. These cells send out axons that cross over (decussate) to the 
opposite side of the brain in the medulla oblongata and then travel down the spinal cord.

connects the two hemispheres (halves). 
In addition, the medulla oblongata contains three important vital centers that regulate 
internal activities of the body: 
1. Respiratory center—controls muscles of respiration in response to chemicals or 
other stimuli 
2. Cardiac center—slows the heart rate when the heart is beating too rapidly 
3. Vasomotor center—affects (constricts or dilates) the muscles in the walls of blood 
vessels, thus influencing blood pressure

medulla oblongata. Table 10-1 reviews the functions of these parts of the brain.

THE SPINAL CORD AND MENINGES 

SPINAL CORD 

The spinal cord is a column of nervous tissue extending from the medulla oblongata to 
the second lumbar vertebra within the vertebral column. Below the end of the spinal cord 
is the cauda equina (Latin for “horse’s tail”), a fan of nerve fibers (see Figure 10-1, page 
345). The spinal cord carries all the nerves to and from the limbs and lower part of the body, 
and it is the pathway for impulses going to and from the brain. A cross-sectional view of the 
spinal cord (Figure 10-10) reveals an inner region of gray matter (containing cell bodies 
and dendrites) and an outer region of white matter (containing the nerve fiber tracts with 
myelin sheaths) conducting impulses to and from the brain.

MENINGES 

The meninges are three layers of connective tissue membranes that surround the brain and 
spinal cord. Label Figure 10-11 as you study the following description of the meninges. 

The outermost membrane of the meninges is the dura mater [1]. This thick, tough 
membrane contains channels (dural sinuses) that contain blood. The subdural space [2] is 
below the dural membrane. The second layer surrounding the brain and spinal cord is 
the arachnoid membrane [3]. The arachnoid (spider-like) membrane is loosely attached 
to the other meninges by web-like fibers, so there is a space for fluid between the fibers and 
the third membrane. This is the subarachnoid space [4], containing CSF. The third layer of 
the meninges, closest to the brain and spinal cord, is the pia mater [5]. It contains delicate 
(Latin pia) connective tissue with a rich supply of blood vessels. Most physicians refer to the 
pia and arachnoid membranes together as the pia-arachnoid.

a point of contact. 
thalamus Main relay center of the brain. It conducts impulses between the spinal 
cord and the cerebrum; incoming sensory messages are relayed through 
the thalamus to appropriate centers in the cerebrum. Latin thalamus 
means room. The Romans, who named this structure, thought this part 
of the brain was hollow, like a little room. 
vagus nerve Tenth cranial nerve (cranial nerve X); its branches reach to the larynx,

PATHOLOGY 

The bones of the skull, the vertebral column, and the meninges, containing CSF, provide a hard box with an 
interior cushion around the brain and spinal cord. In addition, glial cells surrounding neurons form a blood-
brain barrier that prevents many potentially harmful substances in the bloodstream from gaining access to 
neurons. However, these protective factors are counterbalanced by the extreme sensitivity of nerve cells to 
oxygen deficiency (brain cells die in a few minutes when deprived of oxygen). 

Neurologic disorders may be classified in the following categories: 

. Congenital 
. Degenerative, movement, and seizure 
. Infectious (meningitis and encephalitis) 
. Neoplastic (tumors) 
. Traumatic 
. Vascular (stroke) 
CONGENITAL DISORDERS 

hydrocephalus Abnormal accumulation of fluid (CSF) in the brain. 

If circulation of CSF in the brain or spinal cord is impaired, fluid accumulates 
under pressure in the ventricles of the brain. To relieve pressure on the brain, a 
catheter (shunt) can be placed from the ventricle of the brain into the peritoneal 
space (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or right atrium of the heart so that the CSF is 
continuously drained from the brain. 

Hydrocephalus also can occur in adults as a result of tumors and infections. 



NERVOUS SYSTEM 363 


spina bifida Congenital defects in the lumbar spinal column caused by imperfect 
union of vertebral parts (neural tube defect). 
In spina bifida occulta, the vertebral defect is covered over with skin and evident 
only on x-ray or other imaging examination. Spina bifida cystica is a more severe 
form, with cyst-like protrusions. In meningocele, the meninges protrude to the 
outside of the body, and in myelomeningocele (or meningomyelocele), both the 
spinal cord and meninges protrude (Figure 10-14A and B). 
The etiology of neural tube defects is unknown. Defects originate in the early

DEGENERATIVE, MOVEMENT, AND SEIZURE DISORDERS 

Alzheimer disease (AD) 
Brain disorder marked by gradual and progressive mental deterioration 
(dementia), personality changes, and impairment of daily functioning. 

Characteristics of AD include confusion, memory failure, disorientation, 
restlessness, and speech disturbances. Anxiety, depression, and emotional 
disturbances can occur as well. The disease sometimes begins in middle life with 
slight defects in memory and behavior, but can worsen after the age of 70. On 
autopsy there is atrophy of the cerebral cortex and widening of the cerebral sulci, 
especially in the frontal and temporal regions (Figure 10-15A and B). Microscopic 
examination shows senile plaques resulting from degeneration of neurons and 
neurofibrillary tangles (bundles of fibrils in the cytoplasm of a neuron) in the 
cerebral cortex. Deposits of amyloid (a protein) occur in neurofibrillary tangles, 
senile plaques, and blood vessels. The cause of AD remains unknown, although 
genetic factors may play a role. A mutation on chromosome 14 has been linked to 
familial cases. There is as yet no effective treatment. 

amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Degenerative disorder of motor neurons in the spinal cord and 
(ALS) brainstem. 

ALS manifests in adulthood. Signs and symptoms are weakness and atrophy of 
muscles in the hands, forearms, and legs; difficulty in swallowing and talking and 
dyspnea develop as the throat and respiratory muscles become affected. Etiology 
(cause) and cure for ALS both are unknown. 

A famous baseball player, Lou Gehrig, became a victim of this disease in the 
mid-1900s, so the condition became known as Lou Gehrig disease.

epilepsy 



Huntington disease 
(Huntington chorea) 

multiple sclerosis (MS) 

Epilepsy and Seizures 

Chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizure activity. 

Seizures are abnormal, sudden discharges of electrical activity within the brain. 
Seizures are often symptoms of underlying brain pathologic conditions, such as 
brain tumors, meningitis, vascular disease, or scar tissue from a head injury. 
Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal or ictal events) are characterized by a sudden 
loss of consciousness, falling down, and then tonic contractions (stiffening of 
muscles) followed by clonic contractions (twitching and jerking movements of the 
limbs). These convulsions often are preceded by an aura, which is a peculiar 
sensation experienced by the affected person before onset of a seizure. Dizziness, 
numbness, and visual or olfactory (sense of smell) disturbances are examples of an 
aura. Absence seizures are a form of seizure consisting of momentary clouding of 
consciousness and loss of awareness of the person’s surroundings. These include 
petit mal seizures in children. Drug therapy (anticonvulsants) is used for control 
of epileptic seizures. After seizures, there may be neurologic symptoms such as 
weakness called postictal events. 

In temporal lobe epilepsy, seizures begin in the temporal lobe (on each side of 
the brain near the ears) of the brain. The most common type of seizure is a 
complex partial seizure. Complex means impaired consciousness and partial 
indicates not generalized. Commonly these patients have seizures that cause them 
to pause in whatever they are doing, become confused, and have memory problems. 

The term epilepsy comes from the Greek epilepsis, meaning a laying hold of. 
The Greeks thought a victim of a seizure was laid hold of by some mysterious 
force. The word ictal originates from the Latin ictus, meaning a blow or a stroke. 

Hereditary disorder marked by degenerative changes in the cerebrum 
leading to abrupt involuntary movements and mental deterioration. 

This condition typically begins in adulthood and results in personality changes, 
along with choreic (meaning dance-like) movements (uncontrollable, irregular, 
jerking movements of the arms and legs and facial grimacing). 

The genetic defect in patients with Huntington disease is located on 
chromosome 4. Patients can be tested for the gene; however, no cure exists, 
and management is symptomatic. 

Destruction of the myelin sheath on neurons in the CNS and its 
replacement by plaques of sclerotic (hard) tissue. 

One of the leading causes of neurologic disability in persons 20 to 40 years of age, 
MS is a chronic disease often marked by long periods of stability (remission) 
and worsening (relapse). Demyelination (loss of myelin insulation) prevents the 
conduction of nerve impulses through the axon and causes paresthesias, muscle 
weakness, unsteady gait (manner of walking), and paralysis. There may be visual 
(blurred and double vision) and speech disturbances as well. Areas of scarred 
myelin (plaques) can be seen on MRI scans of the brain (Figure 10-16B). Etiology 
is unknown but probably involves an autoimmune disease of lymphocytes reacting 
against myelin. Drugs that are commonly used to treat MS are corticosteroids 
(to reduce inflammation), interferons (to slow the rate of MS symptoms), and 
glatiramer (to block the immune system’s attack on myelin). 

10 
Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which at least two or more seizures appear spontaneously and recurrently. Having a single seizure 
does not mean that the affected person has epilepsy.

myasthenia gravis (MG) 
Autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness of 
voluntary muscles. 

MG is a chronic autoimmune disorder. Antibodies block the ability of acetylcholine 
(neurotransmitter) to transmit the nervous impulse from nerve to muscle cell. 
Onset of symptoms usually is gradual. Brainstem signs are prominent and include 
ptosis of the upper eyelid, double vision (diplopia), and facial weakness. Respiratory 
paralysis is the main clinical concern. Therapy to reverse symptoms includes 
anticholinesterase drugs, which inhibit the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. 
Immunosuppressive therapy is used, including intravenous immunoglobin as 
well as medications such as corticosteroids (prednisone) and methotrexate. 
Thymectomy is also a method of treatment and is beneficial to many patients. 

palsy 
Paralysis (partial or complete loss of motor function). 
Cerebral palsy is partial paralysis and lack of muscular coordination caused by loss 
of oxygen (hypoxia) or blood flow to the cerebrum during pregnancy or in the 
perinatal period. Bell palsy (or Bell’s palsy) (Figure 10-17) is paralysis on one side 
of the face. The likely cause is a viral infection, and therapy is directed against the 
virus (antiviral drugs) and nerve swelling. 

FIGURE 10-17 A, Bell palsy. Notice the 
paralysis on the left side of this man’s face:

NERVOUS SYSTEM 367 


Parkinson disease 
Degeneration of neurons in the basal ganglia, occurring in later life and 

(parkinsonism) leading to tremors, weakness of muscles, and slowness of movement. 
This slowly progressive condition is caused by a deficiency of dopamine, a 
neurotransmitter made by cells in the basal ganglia (see Figure 10-9). Motor 
disturbances include stooped posture, shuffling gait, and muscle stiffness (rigidity). 
Other signs are a typical “pill-rolling” tremor of hands and a characteristic masklike 
lack of facial expression. See Figure 10-18. 
Therapy with drugs such as levodopa plus carbidopa (Sinemet) to increase 
dopamine levels in the brain is palliative (relieving symptoms but not curative). 
Implantation of fetal brain tissue containing dopamine-producing cells is an 
experimental treatment but has produced uncertain results. 

Tourette syndrome 
Involuntary, spasmodic, twitching movements; uncontrollable vocal 
sounds; and inappropriate words. 

These involuntary movements, usually beginning with twitching of the eyelid and 
muscles of the face with verbal outbursts, are called tics. Although the cause of 
Tourette syndrome is not known, it is associated with either an excess of dopamine 
or a hypersensitivity to dopamine. Psychological problems do not cause Tourette 
syndrome, but physicians have had some success in treating it with the anti-
psychotic drug haloperidol (Haldol), antidepressants, and mood stabilizers.

INFECTIOUS DISORDERS 

herpes zoster (shingles) Viral infection affecting peripheral nerves. 
Blisters and pain spread along peripheral nerves (see Figure 10-19A) and are 
caused by inflammation due to a herpesvirus (herpes zoster), the same virus that 
causes chickenpox (varicella). Reactivation of the chickenpox virus (herpes 
varicella-zoster), which remains in the body after the person had chickenpox, 
occurs. Painful blisters follow the underlying route of cranial or spinal nerves 
around the trunk of the body; zoster means girdle. Zostavax is a vaccine to prevent 
shingles. It does not treat shingles and is recommended for people 60 years of age 
and older. 
meningitis Inflammation of the meninges; leptomeningitis. 
This condition can be caused by bacteria (pyogenic meningitis) or viruses (aseptic 
or viral meningitis). Signs and symptoms are fever and signs of meningeal 
irritation, such as headache, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and a stiff neck. 
Lumbar punctures are performed to examine CSF. Physicians use antibiotics to 
treat the more serious pyogenic form, and antivirals for the viral form. 
human immunodeficiency Brain disease and dementia occurring with AIDS. 
virus (HIV) encephalopathy Many patients with AIDS develop neurologic dysfunction. In addition to encephalitis 
and dementia (loss of mental functioning), some patients develop brain tumors 
and other infections. 

10 
NEOPLASTIC DISORDERS 

brain tumor Abnormal growth of brain tissue and meninges. 

Most primary brain tumors arise from glial cells (gliomas) or the meninges 

(meningiomas). Types of gliomas include astrocytoma (Figure 10-19B), 

oligodendroglioma, and ependymoma. The most malignant form of astrocytoma 

is glioblastoma multiforme (-blast means immature) (see Figure 10-19B). Tumors 

can cause swelling (cerebral edema) and hydrocephalus. If CSF pressure is 

increased, swelling also may occur near the optic nerve (at the back of the eye). 

Other symptoms include severe headache and new seizures. Gliomas are removed 

surgically, and radiotherapy is used for tumors that are not completely resected. 

Steroids are given to reduce swelling after surgery. 

A B FIGURE 10-19 A, Shingles. 
B, Glioblastoma as seen on MRI. 


NERVOUS SYSTEM 369 

Meningiomas usually are benign and surrounded by a capsule, but they may 
cause compression and distortion of the brain. 

Tumors in the brain also may be single or multiple metastatic growths. Most 
arise from the lung, breast, skin (melanoma), kidney, and gastrointestinal tract 
and spread to the brain. 

TRAUMATIC DISORDERS 

cerebral concussion Type of traumatic brain injury caused by a blow to the head. 
There is usually no evidence of structural damage to brain tissue and loss of 
consciousness may not occur. Rest is very important after a concussion because it 
allows the brain to heal. Doctors recommend avoiding demanding mental and 
physical activities. 
cerebral contusion Bruising of brain tissue as a result of direct trauma to the head. 
A cerebral contusion usually is associated with a fracture of the skull, as well as 
with with edema and an increase in intracranial pressure. Subdural and epidural 
hematomas occur (see Figure 10-12), leading to permanent brain injury with 
altered memory or speech or development of epilepsy. 
VASCULAR DISORDERS 
cerebrovascular accident 
(CVA) 
Disruption in the normal blood supply to the brain; stroke. 
This condition, also known as a cerebral infarction, is the result of impaired 
oxygen supply to the brain. There are three types of strokes (Figure 10-20): 
1. Thrombotic—blood clot (thrombus) in the arteries leading to the brain, 
resulting in occlusion (blocking) of the vessel. Atherosclerosis leads to this 
common type of stroke as blood vessels become blocked over time. Before 
total occlusion occurs, a patient may experience symptoms that point to 
the gradual occlusion of blood vessels. These short episodes of neurologic 
dysfunction are known as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). 

10 
Blood flows freely through a normal artery. 
Embolic (embolitic) strokes are 
caused by dislodged thrombi (emboli) 
Thrombotic strokes are caused by 
atheromatous plaques that occlude 
cerebral arteries. 
Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by 
cerebral arterial wall rupture. 
that occlude cerebral arteries. 

FIGURE 10-20 Three types of strokes: embolic, hemorrhagic, and thrombotic. 



370 NERVOUS SYSTEM 


2. 
Embolic—an embolus (a dislodged thrombus) travels to cerebral arteries 
and occludes a small vessel. This type of stroke occurs very suddenly. 
3. 
Hemorrhagic—a blood vessel, such as the cerebral artery, breaks and bleeding 
occurs. This type of stroke can be fatal and results from advancing age, 
atherosclerosis, or high blood pressure, all of which result in degeneration of 
cerebral blood vessels. With small hemorrhages, the body reabsorbs the blood 
and the patient makes good recovery with only slight disability. In a younger 
patient, cerebral hemorrhage usually is caused by mechanical injury 
associated with skull fracture or rupture of an arterial aneurysm (weakened 
area in the vessel wall that balloons and may eventually burst). See Figure 
10-21. 
The major risk factors for stroke are hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and heart 
disease. Other risk factors include obesity, substance abuse (cocaine), and elevated 
cholesterol levels. 

Thrombotic strokes are treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant (clotdissolving) 
therapy. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) may be started shortly 
after the onset of a stroke. Surgical intervention with carotid endarterectomy 
(removal of the atherosclerotic plaque along with the inner lining of the affected 
carotid artery) is also possible. 

migraine 
Severe, recurring, unilateral, vascular headache. 
Prodromal symptoms are known as an aura (peculiar sensations that precede the 
onset of illness). Symptoms of aura are temporary visual and sensory disturbances, 
including flashes of light and zigzag lines. Sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) 
and light (photophobia) are associated with the migraine itself. Migraine pain is 
believed to be related to dilation of the blood vessels. Treatment to prevent a 
migraine attack includes medications such as sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex) 
that target serotonin receptors on blood vessels and nerves. Drugs of this type 
reduce inflammation and restrict dilation of blood vessels.

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 


LABORATORY TESTS 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis Samples of CSF are examined. 
CFS analysis measures protein, glucose, red (RBC) and white (WBC) blood cells 
as well as other chemical contents of the CSF. CSF analysis can also detect 
tumor cells (via cytology), bacteria, and viruses. These studies are used to diagnose 
infection, tumors, or multiple sclerosis. 
CLINICAL PROCEDURES 
X-Ray Tests 
cerebral angiography X-ray imaging of the arterial blood vessels in the brain after injection of 
contrast material. 
Contrast is injected into the femoral artery (in the thigh), and x-ray motion 
pictures are taken. These images diagnose vascular disease (aneurysm, occlusion, 
hemorrhage) in the brain. 



10 
372 NERVOUS SYSTEM 

computed tomography (CT) Computerized x-ray technique that generates multiple images of the 
of the brain brain and spinal cord. 

Contrast material may be injected intravenously to highlight abnormalities. The 
contrast leaks through the blood-brain barrier from blood vessels into the brain 
tissue and shows tumors, aneurysms, bleeding, brain injury, skull fractures, and 
blood clots. Operations are performed using the CT scan as a road map. CT scans 
are also particularly useful for visualizing blood and bone. 

Magnetic Resonance Techniques 

magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy create images of the 
(MRI) brain and spinal cord. 

MRI is better than CT at evaluation of brain parenchyma. It is excellent for viewing 
brain damage related to infection, inflammation or tumors. It also is used to look 
for causes of headaches, to help diagnose a stroke, and detect bleeding problems 
and head injury. Contrast material may be used to enhance images. Magnetic 
resonance angiography (MRA) produces images of blood vessels using magnetic 
resonance techniques. 

Radionuclide Studies 

positron emission Radioactive glucose is injected and then detected in the brain to image 
tomography (PET) scan the metabolic activity of cells. 

PET scans provide valuable information about the function of brain tissue in 
patients, to detect malignancy and to evaluate brain abnormalities in Alzheimer 
disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and epilepsy (Figure 10-22). Combined PET-CT 
scanners provide images that pinpoint the location of abnormal metabolic activity 
within the brain. 

Ultrasound Examination 

Doppler ultrasound studies Sound waves detect blood flow in the carotid and intracranial arteries. 

The carotid artery carries blood to the brain. These studies detect occlusion in 
blood vessels.

10 
Other Procedures 
electroencephalography 
(EEG) 
Recording of the electrical activity of the brain. 
EEG demonstrates seizure activity resulting from brain tumors, other diseases, 
and injury to the brain. It can also help define diffuse cortical dysfunction 
(encephalopathies). 
lumbar puncture (LP) CSF is withdrawn from between two lumbar vertebrae for analysis 
(Figure 10-23). 
A device to measure the pressure of CSF may be attached to the end of the needle 
after it has been inserted. Injection of intrathecal medicines may be administered 
as well. Some patients experience headache after LP. An informal name for this 
procedure is “spinal tap.” 
stereotactic radiosurgery Use of a specialized instrument to locate and treat targets in the brain. 
The stereotactic instrument is fixed onto the skull and guides the insertion of a 
needle by three-dimensional measurement. A Gamma Knife (high-energy radiation 
beam) is used to treat deep and often inaccessible intracranial brain tumors and 
abnormal blood vessel masses (arteriovenous malformations) without surgical 
incision. Proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) delivers a uniform dose of 
proton radiation to a target and spares surrounding normal tissue (Figure 10-24 
A and B).

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 

Answers to the following case report and case study are on page 387. 

CASE REPORT: CEREBRAL INFARCTION 

This patient was admitted on January 14 with a history of progressive right hemiparesis for the previous 
1 to 2 months; fluctuating numbness of the right arm, thorax, and buttocks; jerking of the right leg; 
periods of speech arrest; diminished comprehension in reading; and recent development of a hemiplegic 
gait. He is suspected of having a left parietal tumor [the parietal lobes of the cerebrum are on either side 
under the roof of the skull]. 

Examinations done before hospitalization included skull films, EEG, and CSF analysis, which were all 
normal. After admission, an MRI was abnormal in the left parietal region, as was the EEG. 

An MRA study to assess cerebral blood vessels was attempted, but the patient became progressively 
more restless and agitated after sedation, so the procedure was stopped. During the recovery phase from 
the sedation, the patient was alternately somnolent [sleepy] and violent, but it was later apparent that he 
had developed almost a complete aphasia and right hemiplegia. 



NERVOUS SYSTEM 375 
10 
In the next few days, he became more alert, although he remained dysarthric [from the Greek 
arthroun, to utter distinctly] and hemiplegic. 
MRI and MRA with the patient under general anesthesia on January 19 showed complete occlusion of 
the left internal carotid artery with cross-filling of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries from the 
right internal carotid circulation. 
Final diagnosis: Left CVA caused by left internal carotid artery occlusion. 
[Figure 10-25 shows the common carotid arteries and their branches within the head and brain.]

PAIN MEDICATIONS 

Pain is a major symptom in many medical conditions. Both the area of injury and how the brain deals with 
it affect the sensations of pain. Medications to relieve pain (analgesics) act in different ways: 

. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) relieve pain by stopping inflammation. Examples 
are nonprescription drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Excedrin), aspirin (Anacin, Ascriptin, 
Bufferin), and naproxen (Aleve). Other NSAIDS that require a prescription are Toradol (ketorolac) 
and Feldine (pivoxicain). 
. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) relieves fever and mild pain but is not an anti-inflammatory drug. It is not 
clear how acetaminophen works. 
. Narcotics relieve pain by affecting receptors in the brain to control the perception of pain. Examples 
are morphine, codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone, Combinations of narcotics and acetaminophen 
are Vicodin (acetaminophen with hydrocodone) and Percocet (acetaminophen with oxycodone). 
NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND CASE STUDY 

Neuropathic pain is a unique type of pain that accompanies illnesses and trauma. Patients describe this 

pain as: 
. radiating or spreading . abnormal skin sensations (paresthesias): 
. an electric shock–like sensation numbness, tingling, “pins and needles” 
. hot or burning . pain to light touch 
. shooting, piercing, darting, or stabbing . extreme sensitivity to ordinary, innocuous stimuli 
(lancinating) . often independent of movement 
Case Study 

A 68-year-old man awoke one morning with severe pain in his right shoulder. On turning his head or 
lifting his shoulder, he experienced extreme discomfort and lancinating pain. The pain was a sharp, 
burning pain that moved across his shoulder and down into his right arm. Finding a comfortable position 
lying down was difficult. A cervical MRI study showed no bone abnormalities, whereas a neurologic 
examination provided evidence of damage to multiple peripheral nerves. He developed weakness of his 
shoulder muscles and was unable to lift his right arm. Final diagnosis was brachial plexus neuritis [also 
known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome]. The cause of the condition is unknown, but it may be related to a 
flu vaccination he received 2 weeks previously. Treatment consisted of pain medication and physical 
therapy to rehabilitate weakened muscles in his arm and shoulder. 

Questions about the Case Study 

1. The cervical MRI study showed 
a. Damage to the vertebrae in the neck 
b. Nerve entrapment in the upper spine 
c. Damage to multiple peripheral nerves 
d. Normal vertebrae in the neck 
2. Lancinating pain is 
a. Pain to light touch 
b. Characterized by paresthesia 
c. Stabbing, piercing, shooting 
d. Characterized by numbness and tingling 
3. The patient’s diagnosis is best described as 
a. Inflammation of cervical nerve roots affecting his shoulder and arm 
b. Inflammation of a network of nerves in his shoulder that control muscles in his arm

IN PERSON 
This is a first person account of a woman in her mid-forties living with sciatica. 

Five years ago, I wouldn’t have believed that reaching into a laundry basket could change my my life. But in 
January 2009, it did. 

I had gotten my first-ever backache a few days earlier, after a long car trip. A Google search instructed me 
to apply ice for the first 48 hours and then heat, if the pain persisted. My husband took over the kids’ school 
day routine while I recuperated. That third morning, I could hear my younger son rifling around for his 
favorite sweatshirt; I knew it was at the foot of my bed waiting to be sorted. In the instant it took to reach into 
the laundry basket for that sweatshirt, my back went from dull ache to a crippling pain that radiated all the 
way down my left leg, to the tip of my left foot. 

An MRI confirmed the diagnosis: spinal disc herniation, protruding onto the sciatic nerve root, causing the 
leg pain. Surgery being presented as a last resort, I embarked on a crash course of physical therapy, NSAIDs, 
oral steroids, muscle relaxants, epidural steroid injections, and lots and lots of patience. I saw gradual 
improvement for about three months, to the point that I was able to resume a modified daily routine. 

Then, the improvement stopped. Conventional treatment had run its course. I was at the “last resort” stage. 
So I “cried uncle” and requested a surgical consult. The surgeon ordered a follow-up MRI, which showed good 
news: there had been much improvement to the herniation. To my surprise, the MRI also revealed that the 
sciatic nerve was now free and clear of impingement. If the nerve was back to normal, why was I still in such 
pain? Because, it turns out, the nerve was injured by its ordeal. Not uncommon, I was reassured. This 
development took the surgical option off the table. After all, the goal of the surgery would have been to relieve 
the affected nerve from compression by the protruding disc. In my case, even the relieved nerve was causing 
problems, and that meant not surgery, but more patience. The wait began: to see whether the the nerve would 
repair itself—I was told that could take years—or worse, whether I was facing permanent nerve damage. 

Three years later the verdict seems clear: my sciatic nerve sustained what appears to be permanent 
damage. To this day, I have not regained full use of my left leg. Along with chronic, dull pain, there are also 
paresthesias—simultaneous burning and numbness along the path of the sciatic nerve accompanied by 
constant, involuntary muscle spasms. I’ve lost my Achilles jerk reflex, and so unresponsive is my left foot 
that I can’t feel it hit the ground when I’m walking. 

In those critical first months, I thought my options were either resolving the herniation with surgery or 
resolving it without surgery. It never once occurred to me that, four years later, the injury would remain 
unresolved. 

There’s always a new treatment, or specialist, or drug that shows promise or really worked for a friend of a 
friend. Until recently, it felt like I was giving up hope if I didn’t pursue each lead. Now I’m focusing more on 
adapting to my new circumstances than on finding a “cure.” I don’t want my whole life to revolve around 
sciatica. I found a medication which reduces the chronic pain to more of an annoyance than a crisis (with 
occasional flare-ups). 

I missed my old life and wanted it back. At the risk of sounding like a late night pharmaceutical ad, I’m not 
giving up; I’m going on. 

AUTHOR’S NOTE: Everyone’s experience with sciatica is unique. I recently experienced the condition myself, 
resulting from a L4-L5 disk herniation. After 7 months of pain radiating down right leg, 
I had microdiskectomy surgery, which fortunately alleviated my pain and sciatica.

398 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 


11 
INTRODUCTION 

Body cells are dependent on a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen. When the supplies 
are delivered and then chemically combined, they release the energy necessary to do the 
work of each cell. How does the body ensure that oxygen and food will be delivered to all of 
its cells? The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart (a powerful muscular pump) 
and blood vessels (fuel line and transportation network), performs this important work. 
This chapter explores terminology related to the heart and blood vessels. 

BLOOD VESSELS AND THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD 

BLOOD VESSELS 


There are three types of blood vessels in the body: arteries, veins, and capillaries. 

Arteries are large blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Their walls are 
lined with connective tissue, muscle tissue, and elastic fibers, with an innermost layer 
of epithelial cells called endothelium. Endothelial cells, found in all blood vessels, 
secrete factors that affect the size of blood vessels, reduce blood clotting, and promote the 
growth of blood vessels. Because arteries carry blood away from the heart, they must be 
strong enough to withstand the high pressure of the pumping action of the heart. Their 
elastic walls allow them to expand as the heartbeat forces blood into the arterial system 
throughout the body. 

Smaller branches of arteries are arterioles. Arterioles are thinner than arteries and carry 
the blood to the tiniest of blood vessels, the capillaries. 

Capillaries have walls that are only one endothelial cell in thickness. These delicate, 
microscopic vessels carry nutrient-rich, oxygenated blood from the arteries and arterioles 
to the body cells. Their thin walls allow passage of oxygen and nutrients out of the 
bloodstream and into cells. There, the nutrients are burned in the presence of oxygen 
(catabolism) to release energy. At the same time, waste products such as carbon dioxide and 
water pass out of cells and into the thin-walled capillaries. Waste-filled blood then flows 
back to the heart in small venules, which combine to form larger vessels called veins. 

Veins have thinner walls compared with arteries. They conduct blood (that has given up 
most of its oxygen) toward the heart from the tissues. Veins have little elastic tissue and less 
connective tissue than that typical of arteries, and blood pressure in veins is extremely low 
compared with pressure in arteries. In order to keep blood moving back toward the heart, 
veins have valves that prevent the backflow of blood and keep the blood moving in 
one direction. Muscular action also helps the movement of blood in veins. Figure 11-1 
illustrates the differences in blood vessels. Figure 11-2 reviews their characteristics and 
relationship to one another. 


Blood Vessels and Blood 

What color is blood? Blood is bright red in arteries (contains oxygen) and dark red (maroon) in veins 
(contains carbon dioxide). From the outside of the body, blood in veins appears blue because the color 
reflects off the skin. 
How much blood is in the body? The average adult has about 5 quarts (4.7 liters) of blood in his or 
her body. 
What is the length of all the blood vessels? The total length of all the blood vessels in the body is 
60,000 miles!

prevent clotting and regulate the tone of blood vessels. Examples of endothelial secretions are endotheliumderived 
relaxing factor (EDRF) and endothelin (a vasoconstrictor).

CIRCULATION OF BLOOD 

Arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, and capillaries, together with the heart, form a circulatory 
system for the flow of blood. Figure 11-3 is a more detailed representation of the entire 
circulatory system. Refer to it as you read the following paragraphs. (Note that the numbers 
in the following paragraphs correspond with those in Figure 11-3.) 

Blood that is deficient in oxygen flows through two large veins, the venae cavae [1], on 
its way from the tissue capillaries to the heart. The blood became oxygen-poor at the tissue 
capillaries when oxygen left the blood and entered the body cells. 

Oxygen-poor blood enters the right side of the heart [2] and travels through that side 
and into the pulmonary artery [3], a vessel that divides in two: one branch leading to the 
left lung, the other to the right lung. The arteries continue dividing and subdividing within 
the lungs, forming smaller and smaller vessels (arterioles) and finally reaching the lung 
capillaries [4]. The pulmonary artery is unusual in that it is the only artery in the body that 
carries blood deficient in oxygen. 

While passing through the lung (pulmonary) capillaries, blood absorbs the oxygen that 
entered the body during inhalation. The newly oxygenated blood next returns immediately 
to the heart through pulmonary veins [5]. The pulmonary veins are unusual in that they 
are the only veins in the body that carry oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood. The circulation 
of blood through the vessels from the heart to the lungs and then back to the heart again is 
the pulmonary circulation. 

Oxygen-rich blood enters the left side of the heart [6] from the pulmonary veins. The 
muscles in the left side of the heart pump the blood out of the heart through the largest

single artery in the body, the aorta [7]. The aorta moves up at first (ascending aorta) but 
then arches over dorsally and runs downward (descending aorta) just in front of the 
vertebral column. The aorta divides into numerous branches called arteries [8] that carry 
the oxygenated blood to all parts of the body. The names of some of these arterial branches 
will be familiar to you: brachial (brachi/o means arm), axillary, splenic, gastric, and renal 
arteries. The carotid arteries supply blood to the head and neck. 

The relatively large arterial vessels branch further to form smaller arterioles [9]. The 
arterioles, still containing oxygenated blood, branch into smaller tissue capillaries [10], 
which are near the body cells. Oxygen leaves the blood and passes through the thin capillary 
walls to enter the body cells. There, food is broken down, in the presence of oxygen, and 
energy is released. 

This chemical process also releases carbon dioxide (CO2) as a waste product. Carbon 
dioxide passes out from the cell into the tissue capillaries at the same time that oxygen 
enters. Thus the blood returning to the heart from tissue capillaries through venules [11] 
and veins [12] is filled with carbon dioxide but is depleted of oxygen. 

As this oxygen-poor blood enters the heart from the venae cavae, the circuit is complete. 
The pathway of blood from the heart to the tissue capillaries and back to the heart is the 
systemic circulation. 

Figure 11-4 shows the aorta, selected arteries, and pulse points. The pulse is the beat of 
the heart as felt through the walls of arteries.

ANATOMY OF THE HEART 

The human heart weighs less than a pound, is roughly the size of an adult fist, and lies in 
the thoracic cavity, just behind the breastbone in the mediastinum (between the lungs). 

The heart is a pump consisting of four chambers: two upper chambers called atria 
(singular: atrium) and two lower chambers called ventricles. It is actually a double pump, 
bound into one organ and synchronized very carefully. Blood passes through each pump in 
a definite pattern. Pump station number one, on the right side of the heart, sends oxygen-
deficient blood to the lungs, where the blood picks up oxygen and releases its carbon 
dioxide. The newly oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart to pump station 
number two and does not mix with the oxygen-poor blood in pump station number one. 
Pump station number two then forces the oxygenated blood out to all parts of the body. At 
the body tissues, the blood loses its oxygen, and on returning to the heart, to pump station 
number one, blood poor in oxygen (rich in carbon dioxide) is sent out to the lungs to begin 
the cycle anew. 

Label Figure 11-5 as you learn the names of the parts of the heart and the vessels that 
carry blood to and from it. 

Oxygen-poor blood enters the heart through the two largest veins in the body, the venae 
cavae. The superior vena cava [1] drains blood from the upper portion of the body, and the 
inferior vena cava [2] carries blood from the lower part of the body. 

The venae cavae bring oxygen-poor blood that has passed through all of the body to the 
right atrium [3], the thin-walled upper right chamber of the heart. The right atrium 
contracts to force blood through the tricuspid valve [4] (cusps are the flaps of the valves) 
into the right ventricle [5], the lower right chamber of the heart. The cusps of the tricuspid 
valve form a one-way passage designed to keep the blood flowing in only one direction. As 
the right ventricle contracts to pump oxygen-poor blood through the pulmonary valve [6] 
into the pulmonary artery [7], the tricuspid valve stays shut, thus preventing blood from 
pushing back into the right atrium. The pulmonary artery then branches to carry oxygen-
deficient blood to each lung. 

The blood that enters the lung capillaries from the pulmonary artery soon loses its large 
quantity of carbon dioxide into the lung tissue, and the carbon dioxide is expelled. At the 
same time, oxygen enters the capillaries of the lungs and is brought back to the heart via 
the pulmonary veins [8]. The newly oxygenated blood enters the left atrium [9] of the heart 
from the pulmonary veins. The walls of the left atrium contract to force blood through the 
mitral valve [10] into the left ventricle [11]. 

The left ventricle has the thickest walls of all four heart chambers (three times the 
thickness of the right ventricular wall). It must pump blood with great force so that the 
blood travels through arteries to all parts of the body. The left ventricle propels the blood 
through the aortic valve [12] into the aorta [13], which branches to carry blood all over the 
body. The aortic valve closes to prevent return of aortic blood to the left ventricle. 

In Figure 11-6, notice that the four chambers of the heart are separated by partitions 
called septa (singular: septum). (Label Figure 11-6 as you read these paragraphs.) The 
interatrial septum [1] separates the two upper chambers (atria), and the interventricular 
septum [2], a muscular wall, lies between the two lower chambers (ventricles).

Figure 11-6 shows the three layers of the heart. The endocardium [3], a smooth layer of 
endothelial cells, lines the interior of the heart and heart valves. The myocardium [4], the 
middle, muscular layer of the heart wall, is its thickest layer. The pericardium [5], a fibrous 
and membranous sac, surrounds the heart. It is composed of two layers, the visceral 
pericardium, adhering to the heart, and the parietal (parietal means wall) pericardium, 
lining the outer fibrous coat. The pericardial cavity (between the visceral and the parietal 
pericardial layers) normally contains 10 to 15 mL of pericardial fluid, which lubricates the 
membranes as the heart beats.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART 
HEARTBEAT AND HEART SOUNDS 
There are two phases of the heartbeat: diastole (relaxation) and systole (contraction). 
Diastole occurs when the ventricle walls relax and blood flows into the heart from the venae 
cavae and the pulmonary veins. The tricuspid and mitral valves open in diastole, as blood 
passes from the right and left atria into the ventricles. The pulmonary and aortic valves 
close during diastole (Figure 11-8). 
Systole occurs next, as the walls of the right and left ventricles contract to pump blood 
into the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Both the tricuspid and the mitral valves are closed 
during systole, thus preventing the flow of blood back into the atria (see Figure 11-8). 
This diastole-systole cardiac cycle occurs between 70 and 80 times per minute (100,000 
times a day). The heart pumps about 3 ounces of blood with each contraction. This means 
that about 5 quarts of blood are pumped by the heart in 1 minute (75 gallons an hour and 
about 2000 gallons a day). 
Closure of the heart valves is associated with audible sounds, such as “lubb-dubb,” which 
can be heard on listening to a normal heart with a stethoscope. The “lubb” is associated 
with closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves at the beginning of systole, and the “dubb” 
with the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves at the end of systole. The “lubb” sound 
is called the first heart sound (S1) and the “dubb” is the second heart sound (S2) because 
the normal cycle of the heartbeat starts with the beginning of systole. Sometimes the flow 
of blood through the valves can produce an abnormal swishing sound known as a murmur. 
CONDUCTION SYSTEM OF THE HEART 
What keeps the heart at its perfect rhythm? Although the heart has nerves that affect its 
rate, they are not primarily responsible for its beat. The heart starts beating in the embryo 
before it is supplied with nerves, and continues to beat in experimental animals even when 
the nerve supply is cut.

Label Figure 11-9 as you read the following. Primary responsibility for initiating the 
heartbeat rests with a small region of specialized muscle tissue in the posterior portion of 
the right atrium, where an electrical impulse originates. This is the sinoatrial node (SA 
node) or pacemaker [1] of the heart. The current of electricity generated by the pacemaker 
causes the walls of the atria to contract and force blood into the ventricles. 
Almost like ripples in a pond of water when a stone is thrown, the wave of electricity 
passes from the pacemaker to another region of the myocardium. This region is within the 
interatrial septum and is the atrioventricular node (AV node) [2]. The AV node immediately 
sends the excitation wave to a bundle of specialized muscle fibers called the atrioventricular 
bundle, or bundle of His [3]. Within the interventricular septum, the bundle of His divides 
into the left bundle branch [4] and the right bundle branch [5], which form the conduction 
myofibers that extend through the ventricle walls and contract on stimulation. Thus systole 
occurs and blood is pumped away from the heart. A short rest period follows, and then the 
pacemaker begins the wave of excitation across the heart again. 
The record used to detect these electrical changes in heart muscle as the heart beats 
is an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). The normal ECG tracing shows five waves, or 
deflections, that represent the electrical changes as a wave of excitation spreads through 
the heart. The deflections are called P, QRS, and T waves. Figure 11-10 illustrates P, QRS, 
and T waves on a normal ECG tracing. 
Heart rhythm (originating in the SA node and traveling through the heart) is called 
normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Sympathetic nerves speed up the heart rate during conditions 
of emotional stress or vigorous exercise. Parasympathetic nerves slow the heart rate when 
there is no need for extra pumping. 
BLOOD PRESSURE 
Blood pressure is the force that the blood exerts on the arterial walls. This pressure is 
measured with a sphygmomanometer (Figure 11-11). 
The sphygmomanometer consists of a rubber bag inside a cloth cuff that is wrapped 
around the upper arm, just above the elbow. The rubber bag is inflated with air using a hand

bulb pump. As the bag is pumped up, the pressure within it increases and is measured on a 
recording device attached to the cuff. 
The brachial artery in the upper arm is compressed by the air pressure in the bag. When 
there is sufficient air pressure in the bag to stop the flow of blood, the pulse in the lower 
arm (where the observer is listening with a stethoscope) drops. 
Air is then allowed to escape from the bag and the pressure is lowered slowly, allowing 
the blood to begin to make its way through the gradually opening artery. At the point when 
the person listening with the stethoscope first hears the sounds of the pulse beats, the 
reading on the device attached to the cuff shows the higher, systolic blood pressure 
(pressure in the artery when the left ventricle is contracting to force the blood into the 
aorta and other arteries). 
As air continues to escape, the sounds become progressively louder. Finally, when a 
change in sound from loud to soft occurs, the observer makes note of the pressure on the 
recording device. This is the diastolic blood pressure (pressure in the artery when the 
ventricles relax and the heart fills, receiving blood from the venae cavae and pulmonary 
veins). 
Blood pressure is expressed as a fraction—for example, 120/80 mm Hg, in which the 
upper number (120) is the systolic pressure and the lower number (80) is the diastolic 
pressure. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is defined as blood pressure greater than 
140/90 mmHg. Both systolic and diastolic hypertension are associated with increased risk 
of heart attack and stroke.

PATHOLOGY: THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS 


HEART 
arrhythmias Abnormal heart rhythms (dysrhythmias). 
Arrhythmias are problems with the conduction or electrical system of the heart. 
More than 4 million Americans have recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. 

Examples of cardiac arrhythmias are: 

1. bradycardia and heart 
Failure of proper conduction of impulses from the SA node through the 
block (atrioventricular AV node to the atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His). 
block) 
Damage to the SA node may cause its impulses to be too weak to activate the 
AV node and impulses fail to reach the ventricles. The heart beats slowly and 
bradycardia results. If the failure occurs only occasionally, the heart misses a beat 
in a rhythm at regular intervals (partial heart block). If no impulses reach the AV 
node from the SA node, the ventricles contract slower than the atria and are not 
coordinated. This is complete heart block. 

Right and left bundle branch block (RBBB and LBBB) are common types of 
heart block. They involve delay or failure of impulses traveling through the right 
and left bundle branches to the ventricles. 



CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 413 
11 
Implantation of an artificial cardiac pacemaker overcomes arrhythmias and 
keeps the heart beating at the proper rate. The pacemaker power source is a 
generator that contains a computer and lithium battery. It is implanted under the 
skin just below the collarbone, with leads (wires) to both chambers, usually on the 
right side of the heart. A newer type of pacemaker, called a biventricular 
pacemaker, treats delays and abnormalities in ventricular contractions (dysynergy) 
and also can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with 
congestive heart failure. It reduces exacerbations of heart failure that require 
hospital admission (Figure 11-13C). 
How Does a Pacemaker Work? 
The pacemaker leads (wires) detect the heart’s own electrical activity and transmit that information to the generator 
(computer). The computer analyzes the heart’s signals and decides when and where to pace. If the rate is slow, the generator 
emits a signal to stimulate contraction and increase the rate. Pacemakers with multiple leads can pace the atrium and ventricle in 
proper sequence. Rate-responsive pacemakers have sensors that detect body movement and breathing to then determine the 
best heart rate.

atrium and the right and left ventricles to synchronize ventricular contractions.


414 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 

2. flutter Rapid but regular contractions, usually of the atria. 
Heart rhythm may reach up to 300 beats per minute. Atrial flutter is often 
symptomatic of heart disease and frequently requires treatment such as medication, 
electrical cardioversion, or catheter ablation (see below under fibrillation). 

3. fibrillation Very rapid, random, inefficient, and irregular contractions of the heart 
(350 beats or more per minute). 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 
5% to 10% of 70- to 80-year-old people and greater than 15% of individuals in 
their 80s. Electrical impulses move randomly throughout the atria, causing 
the atria to quiver instead of contracting in a coordinated rhythm. Common 
symptoms are palpitations 

(uncomfortable sensations in the chest from 
missed heartbeats), fatigue, and shortness of breath. Patients with paroxysmal AF 
(irregular heartbeats occur periodically and episodically) and permanent or 
persistent AF (irregular heartbeats continue indefinitely) are at risk for stroke. 
This is because ineffective atrial contractions can lead to the formation of blood 
clots in the left atrial appendage (the area where clots form) that may travel to the 
brain. Also, sometimes AF can make the heart beat very fast for long periods of 
time, leading to weakening of the heart muscle. 
In ventricular fibrillation (VF), electrical impulses move randomly throughout 
the ventricles. This life-threatening situation may result in sudden cardiac death 
or cardiac arrest (sudden stoppage of heart movement) unless help is provided 
immediately. If treatment is immediate, VF can be interrupted with defibrillation 
(application of an electrical shock). Defibrillation stops electrical activity in the 
heart for a brief moment so that normal rhythm takes over. Medications such as 
digoxin, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers convert fibrillation to 
normal sinus rhythm. 

An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a small electrical device that 
is implanted inside the chest (near the collarbone) to sense arrhythmias and 
terminate them with an electric shock. Candidates for ICDs are people who have 
had or are at high risk for having ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, 
and cardiac arrest. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) may be found in 
workplaces, airports, and other public places and are used in an emergency 
situation to reverse ventricular fibrillation. 

Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive treatment to treat cardiac arrhythmias. 
The technique, using radiofrequency energy delivered from the tip of a catheter 
inserted through a blood vessel and into the heart, destroys tissue that causes 
arrhythmias. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, 
and ventricular tachycardia (VT) may be treated with ablation when clinically 
indicated. This procedure may provide a permanent cure in many clinical 
situations.

 
Palpitation/Palpation

Don’t confuse palpitation with palpation, which means to touch, feel, or examine with the hands and fingers.

congenital heart disease Abnormalities in the heart at birth. 
The following conditions are congenital anomalies resulting from some failure in the development of 
the fetal heart. 
1. coarctation of the aorta 
(CoA) 
Narrowing (coarctation) of the aorta. 
Figure 11-14A shows coarctation of the aorta. Surgical treatment consists of 
removal of the constricted region and end-to-end anastomosis of the aortic 
segments. 
2. patent ductus 
arteriosus (PDA) 
Passageway (ductus arteriosus) between the aorta and the pulmonary 
artery remains open (patent) after birth. 
The ductus arteriosus normally closes after birth, but in this congenital condition 
it remains open (see Figure 11-14B), resulting in the flow of oxygenated blood 
from the aorta into the pulmonary artery. PDA occurs in premature infants, 
causing cyanosis, fatigue, and rapid breathing. Although the defect often closes on 
its own within months after birth, treatment may be necessary if patency 
continues. Treatments include use of a drug (indomethacin) to promote closure; 
surgery via catheterization (with coil embolization to “plug” the ductus); and 
ligation (tying off) via a small incision between the ribs.

3. septal defects 
Small holes in the wall between the atria (atrial septal defects) or the 
ventricles (ventricular septal defects). Figure 11-15A shows a ventricular 
septal defect. 
Although many septal defects close spontaneously, others require open heart 
surgery to close the hole between heart chambers. Septal defects are closed while 
maintaining a general circulation by means of a heart-lung machine. This 
machine, connected to the patient’s circulatory system, relieves the heart and 
lungs of pumping and oxygenation functions during heart surgery. 

Alternatively, septal defects may be repaired with a less invasive catheter 
technique using a device (Amplatzer device) in the defect to close it. 

4. tetralogy of Fallot 
Congenital malformation involving four (tetra-) distinct heart defects. 
(f.-Lō) 
The condition, named for Etienne Fallot, the French physician who described it in 
1888, is illustrated in Figure 11-15B. The four defects are: 

. Pulmonary artery stenosis. Pulmonary artery is narrow or obstructed. 
. Ventricular septal defect. Large hole between two ventricles lets venous blood 
pass from the right to the left ventricle and out to the aorta without 
oxygenation. 
. Shift of the aorta to the right. Aorta overrides the interventricular septum. 
Oxygen-poor blood passes from the right ventricle to the aorta. 
. Hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Myocardium works harder to pump blood 
through a narrowed pulmonary artery.

congestive heart failure 
(CHF) 

coronary artery disease 
(CAD) 

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 417 

An infant with this condition is described as a “blue baby” because of the 
extreme degree of cyanosis present at birth. Surgery for tetralogy of Fallot 
includes a patch closure of the ventricular septal defect and removing obstruction 
to the outflow at the pulmonary artery. 

Other congenital conditions such as transposition of the great arteries (TGA) 
(pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle and the aorta from the right 
ventricle) cause cyanosis and hypoxia as well. Surgical correction of TGA involves 
an arterial switch procedure (pulmonary artery and aorta are reconnected in their 
proper positions). 

Heart is unable to pump its required amount of blood. 
There are two types of congestive heart failure: systolic and diastolic. In systolic 
CHF, left ventricular dysfunction results in a low ejection fraction (the amount of 
blood that leaves the left ventricle). Less blood is pumped from the heart. In 
diastolic CHF, the heart can contract normally but is “stiff” or less compliant 
when relaxed or filling with blood. Fluid backs up in the lungs and other parts of 
the body. The most common cause of diastolic CHF is hypertension. 

Symptoms of CHF include shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and fluid 
retention. Pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) and swelling or 
edema in the legs, feet, and ankles are common. Treatment includes lowering 
dietary intake of sodium and the use of diuretics to promote fluid loss. 

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (type I), beta-blockers, 
spironolactone (increases excretion of water and sodium by the kidney), and 
digoxin are also used. 

If drug therapy and lifestyle changes fail to control congestive heart failure, 
heart transplantation may be the only treatment option. While waiting for a 
transplant, patients may need a device to assist the heart’s pumping. A left 
ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a booster pump implanted in the abdomen, 
with a cannula (tube) inserted into the left ventricle. It pumps blood out of the 
heart to all parts of the body. LVAD may be used either as a “bridge to transplant” 
or as a “destination” therapy when heart transplantation is not possible. Because 
of the severe shortage of donor hearts, research efforts are directed at developing 
total artificial hearts. 

Disease of the arteries surrounding the heart. 

The coronary arteries are a pair of blood vessels that arise from the aorta and 
supply oxygenated blood to the heart. After blood leaves the heart via the aorta, a 
portion is at once led back over the surface of the heart through the coronary 
arteries. 

CAD usually is the result of atherosclerosis. This is the deposition of fatty 
compounds on the inner lining of the coronary arteries (any other artery can be 
similarly affected). The ordinarily smooth lining of the artery becomes roughened 
as the atherosclerotic plaque collects in the artery.

FIGURE 11-17 Acute myocardial infarction (MI), 5 to 7 days old. 
The infarct is visible as a well-demarcated, pale yellow lesion in the 
posterolateral region of the left ventricle. The border of the infarct is 
surrounded by a dark red zone of acute inflammation. 
The plaque first causes plugging of the coronary artery. Next, the roughened 
lining of the artery may rupture or cause abnormal clotting of blood, leading to 
thrombotic occlusion (blocking of the coronary artery by a clot). Blood flow is 
decreased (ischemia) or stopped entirely, leading to death (necrosis) of a part of 
the myocardium. This sequence of events constitutes a myocardial infarction, or 
heart attack, and the area of dead myocardial tissue is known as an infarct. The 
infarcted area is eventually replaced by scar tissue. Figure 11-16 shows coronary 
arteries branching from the aorta and illustrates coronary artery occlusion leading 
to ischemia and infarction of heart muscle. Figure 11-17 is a photograph of 
myocardium after an acute myocardial infarction. 
Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) are conditions caused by myocardial 
ischemia. These conditions are unstable angina (chest pain at rest or chest pain of 
increasing frequency) and myocardial infarction (Figure 11-18).

thrombus forms, causing unstable angina or NSTEMI (non–ST elevation 
myocardial infarction). D, Alternatively, formation of an occlusive thrombus 
leads to a myocardial infarction or STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction). 
Patients with ACSs benefit from early angiography (x-ray imaging of coronary 
arteries) and PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention with a balloon catheter and 
stents) or CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) to improve blood flow to the 
heart muscle (revascularization). Drugs used to treat ACSs are anticoagulants and 
antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) and 
ticagrelor (Brilinta). 
For acute attacks of angina, nitroglycerin is given sublingually (under the 
tongue). This drug, one of several called nitrates, is a vasodilator that increases 
coronary blood flow and lowers blood pressure. Nitrates also produce venodilation 
to reduce venous return and decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, both of 
which help decrease the work of the heart. 
Physicians advise patients to avoid risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and 
lack of exercise, and they prescribe effective drugs to prevent CAD and ACSs. These 
drugs include aspirin (to prevent clumping of platelets), beta-blockers (to reduce 
the force and speed of the heartbeat and to lower blood pressure), ACE inhibitors 
(to reduce high blood pressure and the risk of future heart attack even if the 
patient is not hypertensive), calcium channel blockers (to relax muscles in blood 
vessels), and statins (to lower cholesterol levels). 
Cardiac surgeons perform an open heart operation called coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) to treat CAD by replacing clogged vessels. Interventional 
cardiologists perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in which 
catheterization with balloons and stents opens clogged coronary arteries.


420 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 


endocarditis Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. 
Damage to the heart valves from infection (bacterial endocarditis) produces 
lesions called vegetations (resembling cauliflower) that break off into the 
bloodstream as emboli (material that travels through the blood). The emboli can 
lodge in other vessels, leading to a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or stroke, or 
in small vessels of the skin, where multiple pinpoint hemorrhages known 
as petechiae (from the Italian petechio, a flea bite) form. Antibiotics can cure 
bacterial endocarditis. 
hypertensive heart disease High blood pressure affecting the heart. 
This condition results from narrowing of arterioles, which leads to increased 
pressure in arteries. The heart is affected (left ventricular hypertrophy) because it 
pumps more vigorously to overcome the increased resistance in the arteries. 
mitral valve prolapse (MVP) Improper closure of the mitral valve. 
This condition occurs because the mitral valve enlarges and prolapses into the left 
atrium during systole. The physician hears a midsystolic click on auscultation 
(listening with a stethoscope). Most people with MVP live normal lives, but 
prolapsed valves can on rare occasion become infected. 
murmur Extra heart sound, heard between normal beats. 
Murmurs are heard with the aid of a stethoscope and usually are caused by a 
valvular defect or disease that disrupts the smooth flow of blood in the heart. They 
also are heard in cases of interseptal defects, in which blood flows abnormally 
between chambers through holes in the septa. Functional murmurs are not 
caused by valve or septal defects and do not seriously endanger a person’s health. 
A bruit (BRū-ē) is an abnormal sound or murmur heard on auscultation. A 
thrill, which is a vibration felt on palpation of the chest, often accompanies a 
murmur. 
pericarditis Inflammation of the membrane (pericardium) surrounding the heart. 
In most instances, pericarditis results from disease elsewhere in the body (such as 
pulmonary infection). Bacteria and viruses cause the condition, or the etiology 
may be idiopathic. Malaise, fever, and chest pain occur, and auscultation with a 
stethoscope often reveals a pericardial friction rub (heard as a scraping or grating 
sound). Compression of the heart caused by collection of fluid in the pericardial 
cavity is cardiac tamponade (t.m-pō-N.D). Treatment includes anti-inflammatory 
drugs and other agents to manage pain. If the pericarditis is infective, antibiotics 
or antifungals are prescribed, depending on the microorganisms detected in 
specimens obtained by pericardiocentesis.

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 421

rheumatic heart disease Heart disease caused by rheumatic fever. 
Rheumatic fever is a childhood disease that follows a streptococcal infection. The 
heart valves can be damaged by inflammation and scarred (with vegetations), so 
that they do not open and close normally (Figure 11-19A). Mitral stenosis, atrial 
fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, caused by weakening of the myocardium, 
also can result from rheumatic heart disease. Treatment consists of reduced 
activity, drugs to control arrhythmia, surgery to repair a damaged valve, and 
anticoagulant therapy to prevent emboli from forming. Artificial and porcine (pig) 
valve implants can replace deteriorated heart valves (Figure 11-19B and C). 
BLOOD VESSELS 
aneurysm Local widening (dilation) of an arterial wall. 
An aneurysm (Greek aneurysma, widening) usually is caused by atherosclerosis 
and hypertension or a congenital weakness in the vessel wall. Aneurysms are 
common in the aorta but may occur in peripheral vessels as well. The danger 
of an aneurysm is rupture and hemorrhage. Treatment depends on the vessel 
involved, the site, and the health of the patient. In aneurysms of small vessels in 
the brain (berry aneurysms), treatment is occlusion of the vessel with small clips. 
For larger arteries, such as the aorta, the aneurysm is resected and a synthetic 
graft is sewn within the affected vessel. Figure 11-20A shows an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (called “AAA”), and Figure 11-20B illustrates a synthetic graft in place. 
Stent grafts also may be placed less invasively as an alternative to surgery in some 
patients. 
Aortic Aneurysms and Marfan Syndrome 
Aortic aneurysms are often associated with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder marked by long, thin fingers, great arm span, 
ocular lens dislocation, and loose joints. Abraham Lincoln is thought to have had Marfan syndrome, and the syndrome has also 
been diagnosed in basketball and volleyball players who have died suddenly as a result of ruptured aortic aneurysms.

11 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
Blood clot (thrombus) forms in a large vein, usually in a lower limb. 
This condition may result in a pulmonary embolism (clot travels to the lung) if 
not treated effectively. Anticoagulants (blood-thinning drugs) such as heparin and 
warfarin (Coumadin) are used to prevent DVTs and pulmonary emboli (PEs). 

hypertension (HTN) High blood pressure. 
Most high blood pressure is essential hypertension, with no identifiable cause. In 
adults, a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater is considered high. Diuretics, 
ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers, are used to treat 
essential hypertension. Losing weight, limiting sodium (salt) intake, stopping 
smoking, and reducing fat in the diet also can reduce blood pressure. 
In secondary hypertension, the increase in pressure is caused by another 
associated lesion, such as glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, or disease of the 
adrenal glands. 

peripheral arterial disease 
Blockage of arteries carrying blood to the legs, arms, kidneys and other 

(PAD) 
organs. 
Any artery can be affected, such as the carotid (neck), femoral (thigh), or popliteal 
(back of the knee). A sign of PAD in the lower extremities is intermittent 
claudication (absence of pain or discomfort in a leg at rest, but pain, tension, and 
weakness after walking has begun). Treatment is exercise, avoidance of nicotine 
(which causes vessel constriction), and control of risk factors such as hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Surgical treatment includes endarterectomy and 
bypass grafting (from the normal proximal vessel around the diseased area to a 
normal vessel distally). 

Percutaneous treatments include balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, and 
stenting. Embolic protection devices are parachute-like filters used to capture 
embolic debris during stenting. 


Warfarin (Coumadin) and Newer Anticoagulants 

While the oral anticoagulant, warfarin, is used to prevent or treat thrombo-embolic diseases, treatment with warfarin requires 
careful monitoring, and is complicated by drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Newer anticoagulants that address these 
limitations have been approved recently by the FDA for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and will likely be expanded to DVT 
and PE. 



CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 423

Raynaud (rā-Nō) disease Recurrent episodes of pallor and cyanosis primarily in fingers and toes. 
Of uncertain cause, this disorder is marked by intense constriction and vasospasm 
of arterioles often of young, otherwise healthy women. Episodes can be triggered 
by cold temperatures, emotional stress, or cigarette smoking. Protecting the body 
from cold and use of vasodilators are effective treatments. 
Raynaud phenomenon is a similar condition of arterial insufficiency but is 
secondary to arterial narrowing from other conditions, such as atherosclerosis, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, or scleroderma. 
varicose veins Abnormally swollen and twisted veins, usually occurring in the legs. 
This condition is caused by damaged valves that fail to prevent the backflow of 
blood (Figure 11-21A to C). The blood then collects in the veins, which distend to 
many times their normal size. Because of the slow flow of blood in the varicose 
veins and frequent injury to the vein, thrombosis may occur as well. Hemorrhoids 
(piles) are varicose veins near the anus. 
Physicians now treat varicose veins with sclerotherapy (injections with 
sclerosing solution) or laser and pulsed-light treatments to seal off veins. Surgical 
interventions such as vein stripping and ligation are used less frequently.

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 


LABORATORY TESTS 
BNP test Measurement of BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) in blood. 
BNP is elevated in patients with heart failure, and it is useful in the diagnosis 
of CHF in patients with dyspnea who come to the emergency department. Its 
presence also identifies patients at risk for complications when presenting with 
acute coronary syndromes (e.g., myocardial infarction and unstable angina). It is 
secreted when the heart becomes overloaded, and it acts as a diuretic to help heart 
function return to normal. 
The reference to brain in this substance originates from its initial identification 
from the brain of a pig. 
cardiac biomarkers Chemicals are measured in the blood as evidence of a heart attack. 
Damaged heart muscle releases chemicals into the bloodstream. The substances 
tested for are troponin-I (cTnI) and troponin-T (cTnT). Troponin is a heart 
muscle protein released into circulation after myocardial injury. 
lipid tests (lipid profile) Measurement of cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) in a blood sample. 
High levels of lipids are associated with atherosclerosis. The general guideline for 
total cholesterol in the blood is less than 200 mg/dL. Saturated fats (of animal 
origin, such as milk, butter, and meats) increase cholesterol in the blood, whereas 
polyunsaturated fats (of vegetable origin, such as corn and safflower oil) decrease 
blood cholesterol. 
Treatment of hyperlipidemia includes proper diet (low-fat, high-fiber intake) 
and exercise. Niacin (a vitamin) also helps reduce lipids. Drug therapy includes 
statins, which reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death. 
Statins lower cholesterol by reducing its production in the liver. Examples are 
simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and pravastatin (Pravachol). 
lipoprotein electrophoresis Lipoproteins (combinations of fat and protein) are physically separated 
and measured in a blood sample. 
Examples of lipoproteins are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL). High levels of LDL are associated with atherosclerosis. The 
National Guideline for LDL is less than 130 mg/dL in normal persons and less than 
70 mg/dL in patients with CAD, PAD, and diabetes mellitus. High levels of HDL 
protect adults from atherosclerosis. Factors that increase HDL are estrogen, 
exercise, and alcohol in moderation. 

CLINICAL PROCEDURES: DIAGNOSTIC 

X-Ray and Electron Beam Tests 

angiography X-ray imaging of blood vessels after injection of contrast material. 

Arteriography is x-ray imaging of arteries after injection of contrast via a catheter 

into the aorta or an artery.

computed tomography 
angiography (CTA) 
Three-dimensional x-ray images of the heart and coronary arteries 
using computed tomography (64-slice CT scanner). 
This newer technique takes hundreds of images of the heart per second. 
Cross-sectional images are assembled by computer into a three-dimensional 
picture. It is less invasive than angiography (contrast material is injected into a 
small peripheral vein with a small needle) and provides excellent views of the 
coronary arteries for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (Figure 11-22A). 
digital subtraction 
angiography (DSA) 
Video equipment and a computer produce x-ray images of blood vessels. 
After taking an initial x-ray picture and storing it in a computer, physicians inject 
contrast material and take a second image of that area. The computer compares 
the two images and subtracts digital data for the first from the second, leaving an 
image of vessels with contrast. 
electron beam computed 
tomography (EBCT or EBT) 
Electron beams and CT identify calcium deposits in and around 
coronary arteries to diagnose early CAD. 
A coronary artery calcium score is derived to indicate future risk of heart 
attack and stroke (see Figure 11-22B). 
Ultrasound Examination 
Doppler ultrasound studies Sound waves measure blood flow within blood vessels. 
An instrument focuses sound waves on blood vessels, and echoes bounce off red 
blood cells. The examiner can hear various alterations in blood flow caused 
by vessel obstruction. Duplex ultrasound combines Doppler and conventional 
ultrasound to allow physicians to image the structure of blood vessels and measure 
the speed of blood flow. Carotid artery occlusion, aneurysms, varicose veins, and 

other vessel disorders can be diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. 

Coronary Artery Calcium Score 

0-99 low risk 
100-399 intermediate risk 
>400 high risk 
A calcium score >400 is associated with a nearly 25% chance of a heart attack or stroke occurring within 10 years. 



CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM 427 
11 
echocardiography (ECHO) Echoes generated by high-frequency sound waves produce images of 
the heart (Figure 11-23A). 
ECHOs show the structure and movement of the heart. In transesophageal 
echocardiography (TEE), a transducer placed in the esophagus provides 
ultrasound and Doppler information (Figure 11-23B). This technique detects 
cardiac masses, prosthetic valve function, aneurysms, and pericardial fluid. 
Nuclear Cardiology 
positron emission 
tomography (PET) scan 
Images show blood flow and myocardial function following uptake of 
radioactive glucose. 
PET scanning can detect CAD, myocardial function, and differences between 
ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy. 
technetium Tc 99m 
sestamibi scan 
Technetium Tc 99m sestamibi injected intravenously is taken up in 
cardiac tissue, where it is detected by scanning. 
This scan is used in persons who have had an MI, to assess the amount of damaged 
heart muscle. It also is used with an exercise tolerance test (ETT-MIBI). Sestamibi 
is a radioactive tracer compound used to define areas of poor blood flow in heart 
muscle. 
thallium 201 scan Concentration of radioactive thallium is measured to give information 
about blood supply to the heart muscle. 
Thallium studies show the viability of heart muscle. Infarcted or scarred 
myocardium shows up as “cold spots.”

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
cardiac MRI Images of the heart are produced using radiowave energy in a magnetic 
field. 
These images in multiple planes give information about left and right ventricular 
function, wall thickness, and fibrosis, aneurysms, cardiac output, and patency of 
peripheral and coronary arteries. The magnetic waves emitted during MRI could 
interfere with implanted pacemakers because of their metal content and heat 
generation, so it is currently contraindicated for a patient with a pacemaker to 
undergo cardiac MRI. However, new MRI-safe pacemakers have been approved. 
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a type of MRI that gives highly detailed 
images of blood vessels. Physicians use MRA to view arteries and blockage inside 
arteries. Gadolinium is the most common contrast agent used for MRI procedures. 
Other Diagnostic Procedures 
cardiac catheterization Thin, flexible tube is guided into the heart via a vein or an artery. 
This procedure detects pressures and patterns of blood flow in the heart. Contrast 
may be injected and x-ray images taken of the heart and blood vessels (Figure 
11-24). This procedure may be used in diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions 
(see under percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] on page 431). 
electrocardiography (ECG) Recording of electricity flowing through the heart. 
Continuous monitoring of a patient’s heart rhythm in hospitals is performed via 
telemetry (electronic transmission of data—tele/o means distant). Sinus rhythm 
begins in the SA node, and the normal rate is between 60 to 100 beats per minute. 
Figure 11-25 shows ECG strips for normal sinus rhythm and several types of 
dysrhythmias (abnormal rhythms).

the cardiologist inserts a catheter through the femoral vein and advances it to the right atrium and right 
ventricle and into the pulmonary artery.

Rhythm changes are correlated with symptoms recorded in a diary. 
stress test Exercise tolerance test (ETT) determines the heart’s response to 
physical exertion (stress). 
A common protocol uses 3-minute stages at set speeds and elevations of a

CLINICAL PROCEDURES: TREATMENT 

catheter ablation 
Brief delivery of radiofrequency energy to destroy areas of heart tissue 
that may be causing arrhythmias 

A catheter is guided through a vein in the leg to the vena cava and into the heart. 
The abnormal electrical pathway is located and ablated (destroyed) via energy 
emitted from the catheter. See Figure 11-26A. 

coronary artery bypass Arteries and veins are anastomosed to coronary arteries to detour 
grafting (CABG) around blockages. 

Internal mammary (breast) and radial (arm) arteries and saphenous (leg) vein 
grafts are used to keep the myocardium supplied with oxygenated blood (Figure 
11-26B). Cardiac surgeons perform minimally invasive CABG surgery using 
smaller incisions instead of the traditional sternotomy to open the chest. Vein and 
artery grafts are removed endoscopically through small incisions as well. 

Although most operations are performed with a heart-lung machine (“onpump”), 
an increasing number are performed “off-pump” with a beating heart. 
See the In Person story, on page 436, of a man who underwent coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery. 

defibrillation 
Brief discharges of electricity are applied across the chest to stop 
dysrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation). 

For patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular dysrhythmias, 
an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or automatic implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is placed in the upper chest. 

Cardioversion is another technique using lower energy to treat atrial fibrillation, 
atrial flutter, and supraventricular tachycardia.

endarterectomy Surgical removal of plaque from the inner layer of an artery.

Carotid endarterectomy is a procedure to remove plaque buildup in the carotid 
artery to reduce risk of stroke. 
extracorporeal circulation Heart-lung machine diverts blood from the heart and lungs while the 
heart is repaired. 
Blood leaves the body, enters the heart-lung machine, where it is oxygenated, and 
then returns to a blood vessel (artery) to circulate through the bloodstream. The 
machine uses the technique of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 
heart transplantation A donor heart is transferred to a recipient. 
While waiting for a transplant, a patient may need a left ventricular assist device 
(LVAD), which is a booster pump implanted in the abdomen with a cannula 
(flexible tube) to the left ventricle. 
percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) 
Balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into a coronary artery to open the 
artery; stents are put in place. 
An interventional cardiologist places the catheter in the femoral or radial artery 
and then threads it up the aorta into the coronary artery. Stents (expandable 
slotted tubes that serve as permanent scaffolding devices) create wide lumens 
and make restenosis less likely. Newer drug-eluting stents (DESs) are coated 
with polymers that elute (release) antiproliferative drugs to prevent scar tissue 
formation leading to restenosis (Figure 11-27). Stents are also placed in carotid, 
renal, and other peripheral arteries. 
PCI techniques include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
(PTCA), stent placement, laser angioplasty (a small laser on the tip of a catheter 
vaporizes plaque), and atherectomy.

withdrawn, the stent supports the artery 
and releases a drug to reduce the risk of 
restenosis. Stents are stainless-steel 
scaffolding devices that help hold open 
arteries, such as the coronary, renal, and 
carotid arteries.

thrombolytic therapy Drugs to dissolve clots are injected into the bloodstream of patients 
with coronary thrombosis. 
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and streptokinase restore blood flow to the 
heart and limit irreversible damage to heart muscle. The drugs are given within 
12 hours after the onset of a heart attack. Thrombolytic agents reduce the 
mortality rate in patients with myocardial infarction by 25%. 
transcatheter aortic valve Placement of a balloon-expandable aortic heart valve into the body via a 
replacement (TAVR) catheter. 
The catheter is guided into the heart through the femoral artery, and a stent valve 
device is inserted via the catheter. This is a new minimally invasive catheter-based 
technology used to treat aortic stenosis.

IN PERSON 
This is a first-person account of coronary artery bypass surgery. 

Possible heart attack? You have to be kidding. I had none of the supposed 
symptoms—shortness of breath or chest pain. Instead, I had bouts of 
atrial fibrillation off and on for several months. I got tired easily, and I 
could feel my blood pressure drop. After lying down for about an hour, I 
was fine, but in November 2010 I decided to get it checked out. 

My cardiologist decided to do a stress test. He put me on a treadmill, 
which seemed like an eternity, and then did some ultrasound on me. I 
work out every day on a treadmill and a recumbent bike, so the test on 
the treadmill wasn’t that difficult, although I loved the words “just a 
couple of seconds to go.” 

The cardiologist at Johns Hopkins told me after the stress test that it 
appeared that I had a slight blockage of an artery. No problem, I thought. 

Angioplasty was recommended. During angioplasty, a catheter was 
inserted up my right arm and, although I was lightly sedated, I still felt 
it, particularly when the doctor hit a problem and had to make a slight 
correction. I was certain that they would put in a stent and I’d be home 


11 
by the weekend. “No,” said my doctor. “You have three blockages and will 
need bypass surgery.” I thought he must be talking about someone else. That can’t be me! 


The blockages did not require immediate surgery. After all, I was pain free and asymptomatic. Still, I asked 
for an early date for surgery and it was set for January, 11, 2011. That was 1/11/11. How odd. 

The triple coronary artery bypass opened me like a beached tuna, and made me an official member of the 
“zipper club.” The atrial fibrillation was fixed with radio-frequency ablation. 

After surgery I had to lie on my back, which meant minimal sleep for a week. Lasix (a diuretic) was my 
biggest problem, along with a dozen pills I had to take far too often. According to my surgeon, who visited me 
a day later, things went well, and I was up and walking the hallways of Hopkins with the help of a nurse and a 
walker. 

I went home in a week. The toughest part of the ordeal, oddly enough, was trying to get to the bathroom in 
time and the bumpy ride home. Those bumps made me hold that pillow as close as I could. Ouch. 

After I returned home, two nurses came for home care, and they were fabulous. I lost about 20 pounds prior 
to the surgery and another 17 pounds afterwards. I went from 210 pounds to around 173 pounds. 

Nowadays, I eat no red meat, nothing with butter, and as little fat and salt as possible. In order words, I eat 
fish primarily. I work out every day (between 30 and 60 minutes), and I have regular checkups with my 
cardiologist. 

I was lucky that the atrial fibrillation alerted my physicians to a deeper problem that may have resulted in 
a heart attack or even death. Secondly, I was fortunate to have some true professionals on hand to get me 
through the darkest days of my life. Many people who had bypass surgery told me I would have more energy 
after surgery due to my new plumbing. That hasn’t occurred yet, but I still have hope, and will continue to 
work toward that goal.

when he was resting. After performing (Holter monitoring, Doppler ultrasound, 
echocardiography) on his leg to assess blood flow, Dr. Shaw found (stenosis, fibrillation, 
endocarditis), indicating poor circulation. She recommended a daily exercise program, low-fat 
diet, careful foot care, and antiplatelet drug therapy to treat Bernard’s intermittent (palpitations, 
hypertension, claudication).

Carol noticed that her 6-week-old son Louis had a slightly bluish or (jaundiced, cyanotic, 
diastolic) coloration to his skin. She consulted a pediatric (dermatologist, hematologist, 
cardiologist), who performed (echocardiography, PET scan, endarterectomy) and diagnosed 
Louis’s condition as (endocarditis, congestive heart disease, tetralogy of Fallot) . 
9. 
Seventy-eight-year-old John Smith has had coronary artery disease and high blood pressure for 
the past 10 years. His history included an acute heart attack, or (MI, PDA, CABG) . He often was 
tired and complained of (dyspnea, nausea, migraine headaches) and swelling in his ankles. His 
physician diagnosed his condition as (aortic aneurysm, congestive heart failure, congenital heart 
disease) and recommended restricted salt intake, diuretics, and an (ACE inhibitor, antibiotic, 
analgesic) . 
10. 
Sarah had a routine checkup that included (auscultation, vasoconstriction, vasodilation) of 
her chest with a (catheter, stent, stethoscope) to listen to her heart. Her physician noticed a 
midsystolic murmur characteristic of (DVT, MVP, LDL). An echocardiogram confirmed the 
diagnosis.

458 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 


12 
INTRODUCTION 

We usually think of respiration as the mechanical process of breathing, the exchange of 
air between the lungs and the external environment. This exchange of air at the lungs is 
called external respiration. In external respiration, oxygen is inhaled (inhaled air contains 
about 21% oxygen) into the air spaces (sacs) of the lungs and immediately passes into tiny 
blood vessels (capillaries) surrounding the air spaces. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a gas 
produced when oxygen and food combine in cells, passes from the capillary blood vessels 
into the air spaces of the lungs to be exhaled. 

Whereas external respiration occurs between the outside environment and the capillary 
blood of the lungs, another form of respiration occurs simultaneously between the individual 
body cells and the tiny capillary blood vessels that surround them. This is internal (cellular) 
respiration, which involves an exchange of gases at the level of the cells within all organs 
of the body. Here, oxygen passes out of the capillaries into tissue cells. At the same time, 
carbon dioxide passes from tissue cells into the capillaries to travel to the lungs for 
exhalation. 

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION 

Label Figure 12-1 as you read the following paragraphs. 

Air enters the body via the nose [1] through two openings called nostrils or nares. Air 
then passes through the nasal cavity [2], lined with a mucous membrane and fine hairs 
(cilia) to help filter out foreign bodies, as well as to warm and moisten the air. Paranasal 
sinuses [3] are hollow, air-containing spaces within the skull that communicate with the 
nasal cavity. They, too, have a mucous membrane lining. Besides producing mucus, a 
lubricating fluid, the sinuses lighten the bones of the skull and help produce sound. 

After passing through the nasal cavity, the air next reaches the pharynx (throat). There 
are three divisions of the pharynx. The first is the nasopharynx [4]. It contains the 
pharyngeal tonsils, or adenoids [5], which are collections of lymphatic tissue. They are 
more prominent in children and, if enlarged, can obstruct air passageways. Below the 
nasopharynx and closer to the mouth is the second division of the pharynx, the 
oropharynx [6]. The palatine tonsils [7], two rounded masses of lymphatic tissue, are in 
the oropharynx. The third division of the pharynx, the laryngopharynx [8], serves as 
a common passageway for food from the mouth and air from the nose. It divides into 
the larynx (voice box) [9] and the esophagus [10]. 

The esophagus leads into the stomach and carries food to be digested. The larynx contains 
the vocal cords and is surrounded by pieces of cartilage for support. The thyroid cartilage 
is the largest and in men is commonly referred to as the Adam’s apple. As expelled air 
passes the vocal cords, they vibrate to produce sounds. The tension of the vocal cords 
determines the high or low pitch of the voice.

FIGURE 12-1 Organs of the respiratory system. 

Because food entering from the mouth and air entering from the nose mix in the pharynx, 
what prevents food or drink from entering the larynx and respiratory system during 
swallowing? Even if a small quantity of solid or liquid matter finds its way into the air 
passages, aspirated food can cause irritation in the lungs and breathing can stop. The 
epiglottis [11], a flap of cartilage attached to the root of the tongue, prevents choking or 
aspiration of food. It acts as a lid over the opening of the larynx. During swallowing, when 
food and liquid move through the throat, the epiglottis closes over the larynx, preventing 
material from entering the lungs. Figure 12-2 shows the larynx from a superior view.

FIGURE 12-2 The larynx, viewed from above (superior view). 

On its way to the lungs, air passes through the larynx to the trachea (windpipe) [12], 
a vertical tube about 4. inches long and 1 inch in diameter. The trachea is kept open by 
16 to 20 C-shaped rings of cartilage separated by fibrous connective tissue that stiffen the 
front and sides of the tube. 

In the region of the mediastinum [13], the trachea divides into two branches, the right 
and left bronchial tubes, or bronchi [14] (singular: bronchus). The bronchi are tubes 
composed of delicate epithelium surrounded by cartilage rings and a muscular wall. Each 
bronchus leads to a separate lung [15] where it divides and subdivides into smaller and finer 
tubes, somewhat like the branches of a tree. 

The small bronchial branches are the bronchioles. Each terminal bronchiole [16] 
narrows into alveolar ducts, which end in collections of air sacs called alveoli [17] (singular: 
alveolus). About 300 million alveoli are estimated to be present in both lungs. Each alveolus 
is lined with a one-cell-thick layer of epithelium. This very thin wall permits an exchange 
of gases between the alveolus and the capillary [18] surrounding it. Blood flowing through 
the capillary accepts oxygen from the alveolus while depositing carbon dioxide into the 
alveolus. Erythrocytes [19] in the blood carry oxygen away from the lungs to all parts of the 
body and carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation. 

Each lung is covered by a double-layered membrane called the pleura. The outer layer of 
the pleura, nearer the ribs, is the parietal pleura [20], and the inner layer, closer to the lung, 
is the visceral pleura [21]. A serous (thin, watery fluid) secretion moistens the pleura and 
facilitates movements of the lungs within the chest (thorax). 

The two lungs are not quite mirror images of each other. The slightly larger right lung is 
divided into three lobes, whereas the smaller left lung has two lobes. One lobe of the lung 
can be removed without significantly compromising lung function. The uppermost part of 
the lung is the apex, and the lower area is the base. The hilum of the lung is the midline 
region in which blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic tissue, and bronchial tubes enter and exit. 

The lungs extend from the collarbone to the diaphragm [22] in the thoracic cavity. The 
diaphragm is a muscular partition separating the thoracic from the abdominal cavity 
and aiding in the process of breathing. It contracts and descends with each inhalation 
(inspiration) and relaxes and ascends with each exhalation (expiration). The downward 
movement of the diaphragm enlarges the area in the thoracic cavity, decreasing internal air 
pressure, so that air flows into the lungs to equalize the pressure. When the lungs are full, 
the diaphragm relaxes and elevates, making the area in the thoracic cavity smaller, thus

PATHOLOGY 

DIAGNOSTIC TERMS 

auscultation 

percussion 

pleural rub 

rales (crackles) 

rhonchi (singular: rhonchus) 

sputum 

stridor 

wheezes 


Listening to sounds within the body. 

This procedure, performed with a stethoscope, is used chiefly for listening to the 
passage of air into and out of the lungs and listening to heart sounds. It is helpful 
to diagnose conditions of the lungs, pleura, heart, and abdomen, as well as to 
determine the condition of the fetus during pregnancy. 

Tapping on a surface to determine the difference in the density of the 
underlying structure. 

Tapping over a solid organ produces a dull sound without resonance. Percussion 
over an air-filled structure, such as the lung, produces a resonant, hollow note. 
When the lungs or the pleural space are filled with fluid and become more dense, 
as in pneumonia, resonance is replaced by dullness. 

Scratchy sound produced by pleural surfaces rubbing against each 

other. 
Pleural rub (also called a friction rub) occurs when the pleura are roughened and 
thickened by inflammation, infection, scarring, or neoplastic cells. It is heard on 
auscultation and can be felt by placing the fingers on the chest wall. 


Fine crackling sounds heard on auscultation (during inhalation) when 
there is fluid in the alveoli. 

These popping or clicking sounds can be heard in patients with pneumonia, 
bronchiectasis, or acute bronchitis. The French word rale means rattle. 

Loud rumbling sounds heard on auscultation of bronchi obstructed by 
sputum. 

These coarse rumbling sounds resemble snoring and are usually caused by 
secretions in larger bronchial tubes. 

Material expelled from the bronchi, lungs, or upper respiratory tract by 

spitting. 
Purulent (containing pus) sputum often is green or brown. It results from 
infection and may be seen with asthma. Blood-tinged sputum is suggestive of 
tuberculosis or malignancy. For a sputum culture, the specimen is maintained in 
a nutrient medium to promote growth of a pathogen. Culture and sensitivity 
(C&S) studies identify the sputum pathogen and determine which antibiotic will 
be effective in destroying or reducing its growth. 

Strained, high-pitched sound heard on inspiration caused by 
obstruction in the pharynx or larynx. 

Common causes of stridor include throat abscess, airway injury, croup, allergic 
reaction, or epiglottitis and laryngitis. 

Continuous high-pitched whistling sounds produced during breathing. 

Wheezes are heard when air is forced through narrowed or obstructed airways. 
Patients with asthma commonly experience wheezing as bronchi narrow and 
tighten.

470 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

UPPER RESPIRATORY DISORDERS 

croup Acute viral infection of infants and children with obstruction of the 
larynx, accompanied by barking cough and stridor. 
The most common causative agents are influenza viruses or respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV). 
diphtheria Acute infection of the throat and upper respiratory tract caused by the 
diphtheria bacterium (Corynebacterium). 
Inflammation occurs, and a leathery, opaque membrane (Greek diphthera, leather 
membrane) forms in the pharynx and trachea. 
Immunity to diphtheria (by production of antibodies) is induced by the 
administration of weakened toxins (antigens) beginning between the sixth and 
eighth weeks of life. These injections usually are given as combination vaccines 
with pertussis and tetanus toxins and so are called DPT injections. 
epistaxis Nosebleed. 
Epistaxis is a Greek word meaning a dropping. It commonly results from irritation 
of nasal mucous membranes, trauma, vitamin K deficiency, clotting abnormalities, 
blood-thinning medications (such as aspirin and warfarin), or hypertension. 
pertussis Whooping cough; highly contagious bacterial infection of the pharynx, 
larynx, and trachea caused by Bordetella pertussis. 
Pertussis is characterized by paroxysmal (violent, sudden) spasms of coughing 
that ends in a loud “whooping” inspiration. 

BRONCHIAL DISORDERS 

asthma 
Chronic bronchial inflammatory disorder with airway obstruction due to 
bronchial edema and constriction and increased mucus production. 

Associated signs and symptoms of asthma are dyspnea, wheezing, and cough. 
Etiology can involve allergy or infection. Triggers for asthmatic attacks include 
exercise, strong odors, cold air, stress, allergens (e.g., tobacco smoke, pet dander, 
dust, molds, pollens, foods), and medications (aspirin, beta-blockers). 

Asthma treatments are: 

. Fast-acting agents for acute symptoms; example is an albuterol inhaler 
(bronchodilator). 

. Long-acting agents for long term control; examples are glucocorticoids 
(inhaled), oral steroids (anti-inflammatory drugs), and leukotriene blockers 
such as Singulair. 
Other conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sinusitis, 
and allergic rhinitis can exacerbate asthma. 

bronchiectasis 
Chronic dilation of a bronchus secondary to infection. 

This condition is caused by chronic infection with loss of elasticity of the bronchi. 
Secretions puddle and do not drain normally. Signs and symptoms are cough, 
fever, and expectoration of foul-smelling, purulent (pus-containing) sputum. 
Treatment is palliative (noncurative) and includes antibiotics, mucolytics, 
bronchodilators, respiratory therapy, and surgical resection if other therapies are 
not effective. 

chronic bronchitis 
Inflammation of bronchi persisting over a long time; type of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

Infection and cigarette smoking are etiologic factors. Signs and symptoms include 
excessive secretion of often infected mucus, a productive cough, and obstruction 



RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 471 

of respiratory passages. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema (lung disease in which 
air exchange at the alveoli is severely impaired) are types of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). 

cystic fibrosis (CF) 
Inherited disorder of exocrine glands resulting in thick mucinous 
secretions in the respiratory tract that do not drain normally. 

This is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a gene. It can be diagnosed 
by newborn screening blood test, sweat test, and genetic testing. CF affects 
the epithelium (lining cells) of the respiratory tract, leading to chronic airway 
obstruction, infection, bronchiectasis, and sometimes respiratory failure. It also 
involves exocrine glands, such as the pancreas (insufficient secretion of digestive 
enzymes leads to poor growth) and sweat glands (salty tasting skin). There is no 
known cure, but therapy includes antibiotics, aerosolized medications, chest 
physiotherapy, and replacement of pancreatic enzymes. Lung transplantation 
becomes necessary for some patients. It can restore lung function and prolong life. 

LUNG DISORDERS 

atelectasis 
Collapsed lung; incomplete expansion of alveoli, (Figure 12-7 page 467). 
In atelectasis, the bronchioles and alveoli (pulmonary parenchyma) resemble a 
collapsed balloon. 

emphysema Hyperinflation of air sacs with destruction of alveolar walls (Figure 
12-9A and B). 
Loss of elasticity and the breakdown of alveolar walls result in expiratory flow 
limitation. There is a strong association between cigarette smoking and 
emphysema. As a result of the destruction of lung parenchyma, including blood 
vessels, pulmonary artery pressure rises and the right side of the heart must work 
harder to pump blood. This leads to right ventricular hypertrophy and right heart 
failure (cor pulmonale). 
Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are both forms of COPD.

tissue. B, Emphysema. Notice 
the overinflation of air sacs and 
destruction of alveolar walls.

472 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

lung cancer Malignant tumor arising from the lungs and bronchi (Figure 12-10). 
This group of cancers, often associated with cigarette smoking, is the most 
frequent fatal malignancy. Lung cancers are divided into two general categories: 
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 
NSCLC accounts for 90% of lung cancers and comprises three main types: 
adenocarcinoma (derived from mucus-secreting cells), squamous cell carcinoma 
(derived from the lining cells of the upper airway), and large cell lung cancer. 
When lung cancer is diagnosed, physicians assess the stage of the tumor 
(determined by its size, lymph node involvement, and any distant areas of spread) 
to prepare a protocol for treatment. 
For localized tumors, surgery may be curative. Staging of NSCLC by assessing 
mediastinal lymph nodes is critical. If nodes are negative, the patient is a good 
candidate for surgery. If nodes are positive, multimodality treatment (chemotherapy 
and irradiation), with or without surgery, is an option. Doctors treat metastatic 
disease (to liver, brain, and bones) with palliative chemotherapy and/or radiation 
therapy. 
In some patients, often nonsmokers, NSCLC may be caused by a mutation 
(change) in epithelial lung tissue. An example is a mutation in the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is sensitive to treatment with EGFR 
inhibitors (Iressa and Tarceva). This is an example of targeted drug therapy for 
cancer. 
SCLC derives from small, round (“oat” cells) cells found in pulmonary 
epithelium. It grows rapidly early and quickly spreads outside the lung. Treatment 
with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may lead to remissions. 

pneumoconiosis 
Abnormal condition caused by dust in the lungs, with chronic 
inflammation, infection, and bronchitis (Figure 12-11A). 
Various forms are named according to the type of dust particle inhaled: 
anthracosis—coal (anthrac/o) dust (black lung disease); asbestosis—asbestos 
(asbest/o) particles (in shipbuilding and construction trades); silicosis—silica 
(silic/o = rocks) or glass (grinder’s disease). 

12 
FIGURE 12-10 Lung cancer. The gray-white tumor tissue is infiltrating the substance of the lung. This 
tumor was identified as a squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinomas arise in major bronchi and 
spread to local hilar lymph nodes. 



RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 473 


B 
pneumonia Acute inflammation and infection of alveoli, which fill with pus or 
products of the inflammatory reaction. 
Etiologic agents are pneumococci, staphylococci, and other bacteria, fungi, or 
viruses. Infection damages alveolar membranes so that an exudate (fluid, blood 
cells, and debris) consolidates the alveoli (sacs become “glued” together, making 
air exchange less effective). An infiltrate is a fluid-filled area within the lungs as 
seen on a chest x-ray or CT scan. Lobar pneumonia (see Figure 12-11B) involves 
an entire lobe of a lung. Bronchopneumonia is a limited form of infection that 
produces patchy consolidation (abscesses) in the lung parenchyma. Treatment 
includes appropriate antibiotics and, if necessary, oxygen and mechanical 
ventilation in severe cases. See the In Person account on page 484 of a woman 
with recurring pneumonia. 
Community-acquired pneumonia results from a contagious respiratory 
infection, caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria (especially Mycoplasma 
bacteria). It usually is treated at home with oral antibiotics. 
Hospital-acquired pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia is acquired during 
hospitalization (Greek nosokomeion means hospital). For example, patients may 
contract pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation or as a hospital-acquired 
infection. 
Aspiration pneumonia is caused by material, such as food or vomitus, lodging 
in bronchi or lungs. It is a danger in the elderly, Alzheimer disease patients, stroke 
victims, and people with esophageal reflux and feeding tubes. 
X-ray images of a normal chest and one with pneumonia are on page 476. 

pulmonary abscess Large collection of pus (bacterial infection) in the lungs. 

pulmonary edema Fluid in the air sacs and bronchioles. 

This condition most often is caused by the inability of the heart to pump blood 
(congestive heart failure). Blood backs up in the pulmonary blood vessels, 
and fluid seeps out into the alveoli and bronchioles. Acute pulmonary edema 
requires immediate medical attention, including drugs (diuretics), oxygen in high 
concentrations, and keeping the patient in a sitting position (to decrease venous 
return to the heart).

Pneumonia 



474 RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 


pulmonary embolism (PE) Clot or other material lodges in vessels of the lung (Figure 12-12A and B). 
The clot (embolus) travels from distant veins, usually in the legs. Occlusion can 
produce an area of dead (necrotic) tissue; this is a pulmonary infarction. PE often 
causes acute pleuritic chest pain (pain on inspiration) and may be associated with 
blood in the sputum, fever, and respiratory insufficiency. CT angiography is the 
primary diagnostic tool for pulmonary emboli. 
pulmonary fibrosis Formation of scar tissue in the connective tissue of the lungs. 
This condition may be the result of chronic inflammation or irritation caused by 
tuberculosis, pneumonia, or pneumoconiosis. 
sarcoidosis Chronic inflammatory disease in which small nodules (granulomas) 
develop in lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. 
The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy or lung 
involvement is visible on chest x-ray in most cases. Many patients are asymptomatic 
and retain adequate pulmonary function. Sarcoidosis may affect the brain, heart, 
liver, and other organs. Other patients have more active disease and impaired 
pulmonary function. Corticosteroid drugs are used to prevent progression of the 
illness. 
tuberculosis (TB) Infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis; lungs usually 
are involved, but any organ in the body may be affected. 
Rod-shaped bacteria called bacilli invade the lungs, producing small tubercles 
(from Latin tuber, a swelling) of infection. Early TB usually is asymptomatic and 
detected on routine chest x-ray studies. Signs and symptoms of advanced disease 
are cough, weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, and pleuritic pain. Antituberculosis 
chemotherapy (isoniazid, rifampin) is effective in most cases. Immunocompromised 
patients are particularly susceptible to antibiotic-resistant TB. It is important and 
often necessary to treat TB with several drugs at the same time to prevent drug 
resistance. 
The PPD skin test (see page 480) is given to most hospital and medical 
employees because TB is highly contagious. A positive PPD test, in the absence of 
infection, requires treatment with isoniazid. 
PLEURAL DISORDERS 
mesothelioma Rare malignant tumor arising in the pleura. 
Mesotheliomas are derived from mesothelium, which forms the lining of the 
pleural surface. These tumors are caused by asbestos exposure.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 475 


pleural effusion Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (cavity). 
Two types of pleural effusions are exudates (fluid from tumors and infections) 
and transudates (fluid from congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or 
cirrhosis). 
pleurisy (pleuritis) Inflammation of the pleura. 
This condition causes pleurodynia and dyspnea and, in chronic cases, pleural 
effusion. 
pneumothorax Collection of air in the pleural space. 
Pneumothorax may occur in the course of a pulmonary disease (emphysema, 
carcinoma, tuberculosis, or lung abscess) when a break in the lung surface 
releases air into the pleural space. This allows communication between an 
alveolus or bronchus and the pleural cavity. It may also follow trauma and 
perforation of the chest wall or prolonged high-flow oxygen delivered by a 
respirator in an intensive care unit (ICU). 
Pleurodesis (-desis means to bind) is the artificial production of adhesions 
between the parietal and visceral pleura for treatment of persistent pneumothorax 
and severe pleural effusion. This is accomplished by using talc powder or drugs, 
such as antibiotics, that cause irritation and scarring of the pleura.

Rod-shaped bacteria (cause of tuberculosis). 
chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease 
(COPD) 
Chronic condition of persistent obstruction of air flow through bronchial tubes and 
lungs. COPD is caused by smoking, air pollution, chronic infection, and, in a minority 
of cases, asthma. Patients with predominant chronic bronchitis COPD are referred 
to as “blue bloaters” (cyanotic, stocky build), whereas those with predominant 
emphysema are called “pink puffers” (short of breath, but with near-normal blood 
oxygen levels, and no change in skin color). 
cor pulmonale Failure of the right side of the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood to the lungs 
because of underlying lung disease. 
exudates Fluid, cells, and other substances (pus) that filter from cells or capillaries ooze into 
lesions or areas of inflammation. 
hydrothorax Collection of fluid in the pleural cavity. 
infiltrate Collection of fluid or other material within the lung, as seen on a chest film, CT scan, 
or other radiologic image. 
palliative Relieving symptoms, but not curing the disease. 
paroxysmal Pertaining to a sudden occurrence, such as a spasm or seizure; oxysm/o means sudden. 
pulmonary infarction Area of necrosis (death of lung tissue). 
purulent Containing pus. 
silicosis Disease due to silica or glass dust in the lungs; occurs in mining occupations.

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

X-RAY TESTS 

chest x-ray (CXR) Radiographic image of the thoracic cavity (chest film). 

Chest x-rays are taken in the frontal (coronal) plane as posteroanterior (PA) or 
anteroposterior (AP) views and in the sagittal plane as lateral views. Figure 12-13A 
and B shows a normal chest film and an x-ray film of the chest with pneumonia. 

computed tomography (CT) Computer-generated series of x-ray images show thoracic structures in 
scan of the chest cross section and other planes. 

This test is for diagnosis of lesions difficult to assess by conventional x-ray studies, 
such as those in the lungs, mediastinum, and pleura. 

CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the combination of CT scanning and 

angiography. It is useful to examine the pulmonary circulation in the diagnosis of 

a pulmonary embolism. 

MAGNETIC IMAGING 

magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic waves create detailed images of the chest in frontal, lateral 
(MRI) of the chest (sagittal), and cross-sectional (axial) planes. 

This test is helpful in defining mediastinal tumors (such as those of Hodgkin 
disease) difficult to assess by CT scan.

NUCLEAR MEDICINE TESTS 
positron emission 
tomography (PET) scan of 
the lung 
Radioactive glucose is injected and images reveal metabolic activity in 
the lungs. 
This scanning technique can identify malignant tumors, which have higher 
metabolic activity. It is also used to assess small nodules seen on a CT scan. 
ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) 
scan 
Detection device records radioactivity in the lung after injection of a 
radioisotope or inhalation of small amount of radioactive gas (xenon). 
This test can identify areas of the lung not receiving adequate air flow (ventilation) 
or blood flow (perfusion). Q is the symbol for blood volume or rate of blood flow. 
OTHER PROCEDURES 
bronchoscopy Fiberoptic endoscope examination of the bronchial tubes. 
A physician places the bronchoscope through the throat, larynx, and trachea into 
the bronchi for diagnosis, biopsy, or collection of secretions. In bronchoalveolar 
lavage (bronchial washing), fluid is injected and withdrawn. In bronchial brushing, 
a brush is inserted through the bronchoscope and is used to scrape off tissue 
(Figure 12-14). 
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is performed during bronchoscopy to 
diagnose and stage lung cancer. An EBUS-guided forceps biopsy allows for 
sampling of small (<3 cm) peripheral lesions endoscopically.

endotracheal intubation Placement of a tube through the mouth into the pharynx, larynx, and 
trachea to establish an airway (Figure 12-15). 
This procedure also allows the patient to be placed on a mechanical ventilator (an 
apparatus that moves air into and out of the lungs). 
laryngoscopy Visual examination of the voice box. 
A lighted, flexible endoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the larynx. 
lung biopsy Removal of lung tissue followed by microscopic examination. 
Specimens may be obtained by bronchoscopy, thoracotomy (open-lung biopsy), 
or by needle biopsy through the chest wall. 
mediastinoscopy Endoscopic visual examination of the mediastinum. 
An incision is made above the breastbone (suprasternal) for inspection and biopsy 
of lymph nodes in the underlying space (mediastinum). 
pulmonary function tests 
(PFTs) 
Tests that measure the ventilation mechanics of the lungs: airway 
function, lung volume, and the capacity of the lungs to exchange 
oxygen and carbon dioxide efficiently. See Figure 12-16. 
PFTs are used for many reasons: (1) to evaluate patients with shortness of breath 
(SOB); (2) to monitor lung function in patients with known respiratory disease; 
(3) to evaluate disability; and (4) to assess lung function before surgery. A 
spirometer measures the volume and rate of air passing into and out of the lung. 
PFTs determine if lung disease is obstructive, restrictive, or both. In 
obstructive lung disease, airways are narrowed, which results in resistance to air 
flow during breathing. A hallmark PFT abnormality in obstructive disease is 
decreased expiratory flow rate or FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in the first 
second of expiration). Examples of obstructive lung diseases are asthma, COPD, 
bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiolitis. 
In restrictive lung disease, expansion of the lung is limited by disease that 
affects the chest wall, pleura, or lung tissue itself. A hallmark PFT abnormality in 
restrictive disease is decreased total lung capacity (TLC). Examples of lung 
conditions that stiffen and scar the lung are pulmonary fibrosis, radiation damage 
to the lung, and pneumoconiosis. Other causes of restrictive lung disease are 
neuromuscular conditions that affect the lung, such as myasthenia gravis, 
muscular dystrophy, and diaphragmatic weakness and paralysis.

The ability of gas to diffuse across the alveolar-capillary membrane is assessed 
by determining the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A 
patient breathes in a small amount of carbon monoxide (CO), and the length of 
time it takes the gas to enter the bloodstream is measured.

thoracotomy 
Large surgical incision of the chest. 

The incision is large, cutting into bone, muscle, and cartilage. It is necessary for 
lung biopsies and resections (lobectomy and pneumonectomy). 

thoracoscopy (thorascopy) 
Visual examination of the chest via small incisions and use of an 

endoscope. 
Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) allows the surgeon to view the chest 
from a video monitor. The thorascope (thoracoscope) is equipped with a camera 
that magnifies the image on the monitor. Thoracoscopy can diagnose and treat 
conditions of the lung, pleura, and mediastinum. 

tracheostomy 
Surgical creation of an opening into the trachea through the neck. 

A tube is inserted to create an airway. The tracheostomy tube may be permanent 
as well as an emergency device (Figure 12-18). A tracheotomy is the incision 
necessary to create a tracheostomy. 

tuberculin test 
Determines past or present tuberculous infection based on a positive 

skin reaction. 
Examples are the Heaf test and the tine test, using purified protein derivative 
(PPD) applied with multiple punctures of the skin, and the Mantoux test, using 
PPD given by intradermal injection. 


tube thoracostomy 
A flexible, plastic chest tube is passed into the pleural space through an 
opening in the chest. 

This procedure is used to continuously remove air (pneumothorax), fluid (pleural 
effusion), or pus (empyema). See Figure 12-19.

Reproduced here are actual medical reports using terms that you have studied in this and previous chapters. 
Explanations of more difficult terms are added in brackets. Answers to the questions for the autopsy report 
are on page 493. 

CASE REPORT 

A 22-year-old known heroin abuser was admitted to an emergency department comatose with shallow 
respirations. Routine laboratory studies and chest x-ray studies were done after the patient was aroused. 
He was then transferred to the ICU. He complained of left-sided chest pain. Examination of the chest x-ray 
showed three fractured ribs on the right and a large right pleural effusion. Further questioning of a friend 
revealed that he had fallen and struck the corner of a table after injecting heroin. 



RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 483 


The diagnosis was traumatic hemothorax secondary to rib fractures, and a chest tube was inserted into 
the right pleural space. No blood could be obtained despite maneuvering of the tube. Another chest x-ray 
showed that the tube was correctly placed in the right pleural space, but the fractured ribs and pleural 
effusion were on the left. The radiologist then realized that he had reversed the first film. A second tube 
was inserted into the left pleural space, and 1500 mL [6 to 7 cups] of blood was evacuated. 

AUTOPSY REPORT 

Adenocarcinoma, bronchogenic, left lung, with extensive mediastinal, pleural, and pericardial involvement. 
Metastasis to tracheobronchial lymph nodes, liver, lumbar vertebrae. Pulmonary emboli, multiple, recent, 
with recent infarct of left lower lobe. The tumor apparently originated at the left main bronchus and 
extends peripherally. Parenchyma (alveoli) is particularly atelectatic with a centrally located area of 
hemorrhage in the lower lobe.

a. 
Alveoli are filled with tumor. 
b. Alveoli are collapsed, with central area of bleeding. 
c. 
Alveoli are filled with pus and blood. 
X-RAY AND BRONCHOSCOPY REPORTS

 1. 
CXR: Complete opacification of left hemithorax with deviation of mediastinal structures of right side. 
Massive pleural effusion. 
2. 
Chest tomograms: Mass most compatible with LUL bronchogenic carcinoma. Possible left 
paratracheal adenopathy or direct involvement of mediastinum. 
3. 
Bronchoscopy: Larynx, trachea, carina [area of bifurcation or forking of the trachea], and left lung 
all within normal limits. On the right side there was irregularity and roughening of the bronchial 
mucosa on the lateral aspect of the bronchial wall. This irregularity extended into the RUL, and the 
apical and posterior segments [divisions of lobes of the lung] each contained inflamed irregular 
mucosa. Conclusion: Suspicious for infiltrating tumor, but may be nonspecific inflammation. 
Bronchial washings, brushings, and bxs [biopsies] taken. Bronchial biopsy diagnosis: squamous cell 
carcinoma. Washings and brushings showed no malignant cells.

IN PERSON 


This is a first-person account of a woman with recurring pneumonia. 

While growing up in West Virginia in the 1940s and 50s, I was frighteningly 
aware of the prevalence of lung diseases. With coal mining at its peak, large 
numbers of miners suffered and died from black lung disease. Tuberculosis was 
not uncommon and neither was pneumonia. Little did I imagine, then or in 
1999, when I first contracted the disease, that recurring pneumonia would 
become my most troublesome medical issue. 

As bitterly cold temperatures persisted during the winter of 1999, I was not 
particularly concerned about a lingering cold and cough. But when I developed 
a low-grade fever and decreased energy, a chest x-ray confirmed that I had 
pneumonia in my left lung (lower lobe). My doctor prescribed a one-week 
course of antibiotics and reassured me that the diagnosis was not unusual. I 


12 
quickly improved and a follow-up x-ray showed that the pneumonia had cleared. 
My doctor then suggested that I receive the pneumonia vaccine, which produces antibodies against many 
types of pneumococcal bacteria. End of story. Or so I thought. 


In October of 2001, at age 60, I began training to run the Boston Marathon. A few days after a long training 
run in January of 2002, cough and cold symptoms, a low-grade fever, and rather marked fatigue set in. The 
thought of pneumonia did not cross my mind initially. But, when symptoms didn’t improve, a visit to my 
doctor and chest x-ray confirmed my second diagnosis of pneumonia, again in my left lower lobe. I felt some 
relief when my physician, a pulmonologist and a serious runner himself, assured me that cold weather training 
had not caused the pneumonia. I recovered quickly, after a two-week course of antibiotics, and resumed 
training, completing the marathon in April. A follow-up chest CT performed in May showed no abnormal 
result, and a bronchoscopy in June ruled out any malignancy that might have led to pneumonia. Relieved, I 
assumed I was finished with pneumonia. 

However, pneumonia wasn’t finished with me. The next bout came three years later, in the right upper lobe. 
After antibiotic treatment, I managed to be pneumonia-free for the next six years. But in late July of 2011, I 
experienced a cold and cough in hot weather, which was quite unusual for me. Surely this can’t be pneumonia. 
After all, it has been 6 years! I began to wonder when tightness in my upper chest and extreme fatigue followed 
the cold and cough symptoms. Sure enough, I had pneumonia once again. With this latest diagnosis, my 
doctor became more focused on identifying the possible underlying cause(s) of my recurring pneumonia. 

The disease hit again just six months later, in December of 2011. After appearing to resolve following two 
weeks of antibiotics, the pneumonia returned less than a month later. Now, to see if there was an issue with 
my immune system, my doctor ordered immunoglobulin (antibody) testing. The results were normal. No 
clues here. Another pneumonia episode occurred in May of 2012, this time accompanied by a 104-degree fever. 
This one took a little longer to resolve, again with antibiotics. By this time my levels of bewilderment and 
anxiety were going up a notch with each episode. 

With the referral of my doctor, I sought out a pulmonologist, one who specializes in the treatment of 
pneumonia, to undergo additional studies that might yield useful information. Over a two-day period, 
pulmonary function tests were conducted, and computers tracked the results. I was given albuterol, a 
substance that aids in breathing and is often administered to people who have asthma. But the albuterol did 
not increase my breathing efficiency significantly. Other tests ruled out various other abnormalities. 

With all the information, gathered and evaluated by experts, what happens next? At this point, the doctors 
conclude that my pneumonia is probably idiopathic. They suggest that I have a follow-up CT scan and additional 
testing when pneumonia episodes actually occur. They also caution me about exposure around children and 
hospitalized patients. I asked my lung specialist if he thought this pneumonia puzzle would ever be resolved. 
His reply was, “Something is going on that we will eventually understand. We just haven’t figured it out yet.” 
Unsettling and stress producing as this has been, I know I am fortunate to be dealing with an illness that has, 
so far, responded to medication. Still, every time I get cold signs and symptoms, I worry. And I never take good 
health for granted.

1. Ruth was having difficulty taking a deep breath, and her chest x-ray showed accumulation of fluid 
in her pleural spaces. Dr. Smith ordered (PPD, tracheotomy, thoracentesis) to relieve the pressure 
on her lungs. 
2. Dr. Wong used her stethoscope to perform (percussion, auscultation, thoracentesis) on the 
patient’s chest. 
3. Before making a decision to perform surgery on Mrs. Hope, an 80-year-old woman with lung 
cancer, her physicians ordered (COPD, bronchoscopy, PFTs) to determine the functioning of her 
lungs. 
4. Sylvia produced yellow-colored sputum and had a high fever. Her physician told her that she 
probably had (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax) and needed antibiotics. 
5. The night before her thoracotomy for lung biopsy, Mrs. White was told by her anesthesiologist that 
he would place a/an (thoracostomy tube, mediastinoscope, endotracheal tube) down her throat to 
keep her airway open during surgery. 
6. Early in her pregnancy, Sonya had a routine (PET scan, CXR, MRI) that revealed a/an (epiglottic, 
alveolar, mediastinal) mass in the area between her lungs. After delivery of her child, the mass was 
removed, and biopsy revealed a malignant thymoma (tumor of the thymus gland). 
7. Five-year-old Seth was allergic to cats and experienced wheezing, coughing, and difficult breathing 
at night when he was trying to sleep. After careful evaluation by a (cardiologist, pulmonologist, 
neurologist), his parents were told that Seth had (pleurisy, sarcoidosis, asthma) involving 
inflammation of his (nasal passages, pharynx, bronchial tubes). 
8. Six-year-old Daisy had a habit of picking her nose. During the winter months, heat in her family’s 
house caused drying of her nasal (mucus, mucous, pleural) membranes. She had frequent bouts of 
(epistaxis, croup, stridor). 
9. Seventy-five-year-old Beatrice had been a pack-a-day smoker all of her adult life. Over the previous 
3 months she noticed a persistent cough, weight loss, blood in her sputum (hemoptysis, 
hematemesis, asbestosis), and dyspnea. A chest CT scan revealed a mass. Biopsy confirmed the 
diagnosis of (tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, adenocarcinoma), which is a type of (small cell, 
non–small cell, lymph node) lung cancer. 
10. Carrie’s lungs were normal at birth, but thick bronchial secretions soon blocked her (arterioles, 
venules, bronchioles), which became inflamed. She was losing weight, and tests revealed 
inadequate amounts of pancreatic enzymes necessary for digestion of fats and proteins. Her 
pediatrician diagnosed her hereditary condition as (chronic bronchitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis).

502 BLOOD SYSTEM 


13 
INTRODUCTION 

The primary function of blood is to maintain a constant environment for the other living 
tissues of the body. Blood transports nutrients, gases, and wastes to and from the cells 
of the body. Nutrients from food, digested in the stomach and small intestine, pass into 
the bloodstream through the lining cells of the small intestine. Blood then carries these 
nutrients to all body cells. Oxygen enters the body through the air sacs of the lungs. Red 
blood cells then transport the oxygen to cells throughout the body. Blood also helps remove 
the waste products released by cells. It carries gaseous waste (such as carbon dioxide) to the 
lungs to be exhaled. It carries chemical waste, such as urea, to the kidneys to be excreted in 
the urine. 

Blood transports chemical messengers called hormones from their sites of secretion 
in glands, such as the thyroid or pituitary, to distant sites where they regulate growth, 
reproduction, and energy production. These hormones are discussed later in the endocrine 
chapter. 

Finally, blood contains proteins, white blood cells and antibodies that fight infection, and 
platelets (thrombocytes) and other proteins that help the blood to clot. 

COMPOSITION AND FORMATION OF BLOOD 

Blood is composed of cells, or formed elements, suspended in a clear, straw-colored liquid 
called plasma. The cells normally constitute 45% of the blood volume and include 
erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and platelets or thrombocytes 
(clotting cells). The remaining 55% of blood is plasma, a solution of water, proteins, sugar, 
salts, hormones, lipids, and vitamins. 

CELLS 

Beginning at birth, all blood cells originate in the marrow cavity of bones. Both the red 
blood cells that carry oxygen and the white blood cells that fight infection arise from the 
same blood-forming or hematopoietic stem cells. Under the influence of proteins in the 
blood and bone marrow, stem cells change their size and shape to become specialized, or 
differentiated. In this process, the cells change in size from large (immature cells) to small 
(mature forms), and the cell nucleus shrinks (in red cells, the nucleus actually disappears). 
Figure 13-1 illustrates these changes in the formation of blood cells. Use Figure 13-1 as a 
reference as you learn the names of mature blood cells and their earlier forms. 

ERYTHROCYTES 

As a red blood cell matures (from erythroblast to erythrocyte), it loses its nucleus and 
assumes the shape of a biconcave disk. This shape (a depressed or hollow surface on each 
side of the cell, resembling a cough drop with a thin central portion) allows for a large 
surface area so that absorption and release of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) can take 
place (Figure 13-2A and B). Red cells contain the unique protein hemoglobin, composed of 
heme (iron-containing pigment) and globin (protein). Hemoglobin enables the erythrocyte 
to carry oxygen. The combination of oxygen and hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) produces 
the bright red color of blood.

Progenitor cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Myeloid progenitor cells give rise to erythroblasts, megakaryoblasts, 
and myeloblasts. Lymphoid progenitor cells give rise to monoblasts and lymphoblasts. Notice that the suffix -blast indicates 
immature forms of all cells. Band cells are identical to segmented granulocytes except that the nucleus is U-shaped and its lobes are 
connected by a band rather than by a thin thread as in segmented forms.

504 BLOOD SYSTEM 


Erythrocytes originate in the bone marrow. The hormone called erythropoietin (secreted 
by the kidneys) stimulates their production (-poiesis means formation). Erythrocytes live 
and fulfill their role of transporting gases for about 120 days in the bloodstream. After this 
time, macrophages (in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow) destroy the worn-out erythrocytes. 
This process is called hemolysis. From 2 to 10 million red cells are destroyed each second, 
but because they are constantly replaced, the number of circulating cells remains constant 
(4 to 6 million per μL of blood). 

Macrophages break down erythrocytes and hemoglobin into heme and globin (protein) 
portions. The heme releases iron and decomposes into a yellow-orange pigment called 
bilirubin. The iron in hemoglobin is used again to form new red cells or is stored in the 
spleen, liver, or bone marrow. Bilirubin is excreted into bile by the liver, and from bile it 
enters the small intestine via the common bile duct. Finally it is excreted in the stool, 
where its color changes to brown. Figure 13-3 reviews the sequence of events in hemoglobin 
breakdown. 

LEUKOCYTES 

White blood cells (7000 to 9000 cells per μL of blood) are less numerous than erythrocytes, 
but there are five different types of mature leukocytes, shown in Figure 13-4. These are 
three polymorphonuclear granulocytic leukocytes (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) 
and two mononuclear agranulocytic leukocytes (lymphocyte and monocyte). 

The granulocytes, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), are the most numerous 
(about 60%). Basophils contain granules that stain dark blue with a basic (alkaline) dye. 
These granules contain heparin (an anticlotting substance) and histamine (a chemical 
released in allergic responses). Eosinophils contain granules that stain with eosin, a red 
acidic dye. These granules increase in allergic responses and engulf substances that trigger 
the allergies. Neutrophils contain granules that are neutral; they do not stain intensely and 
show only a pale color. Neutrophils are phagocytes (phag/o means to eat or swallow) that 
accumulate at sites of infection, where they ingest and destroy bacteria. Figure 13-5 shows 
phagocytosis by a neutrophil. 

Specific proteins called colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) promote the growth of 
granulocytes in bone marrow. G-CSF (granulocyte CSF) and GM-CSF (granulocytemacrophage 
CSF) are given to restore granulocyte production in cancer patients. 
Erythropoietin, like CSFs, can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques. It stimulates 
red blood cell production (erythropoiesis).

Although all granulocytes are polymorphonuclear (they have multilobed nuclei), the 
term polymorphonuclear granulocytes (“polys”) often describe the neutrophil, which is 
the most numerous of the granulocytes. 

Mononuclear (containing one large nucleus) leukocytes do not have large numbers of 
granules in their cytoplasm, but they may have a few granules. These are lymphocytes and 
monocytes (see Figure 13-1). Lymphocytes are made in bone marrow and lymph nodes and 
circulate both in the bloodstream and in the parallel circulating system, the lymphatic 
system. 

Lymphocytes play an important role in the immune response that protects the body 
against infection. They can directly attack foreign matter and, in addition, make antibodies 
that neutralize and can lead to the destruction of foreign antigens (bacteria and viruses). 
Monocytes are phagocytic cells that also fight disease. As macrophages, they move from the 
bloodstream into tissues and dispose of dead and dying cells and other tissue debris by 
phagocytosis.

functions. 

PLATELETS (THROMBOCYTES) 

Platelets, actually blood cell fragments, are formed in bone marrow from giant cells 
with multilobed nuclei called megakaryocytes (Figure 13-6A and B). Tiny fragments of a 
megakaryocyte break off to form platelets. The main function of platelets is to help blood to 
clot. Specific terms related to blood clotting are discussed later in this chapter. 

PLASMA 

Plasma, the liquid part of the blood, consists of water, dissolved proteins, sugar, wastes, 
salts, hormones, and other substances. The four major plasma proteins are albumin, 
globulins, fibrinogen, and prothrombin (the last two are clotting proteins). 

Albumin maintains the proper proportion (and concentration) of water in the blood. 
Because albumin cannot pass easily through capillary walls, it remains in the blood and

BLOOD SYSTEM 507 
13 
carries smaller molecules bound to its surface. It attracts water from the tissues back into 
the bloodstream and thus opposes the water’s tendency to leave the blood and leak out 
into tissue spaces. Edema (swelling) results when too much fluid from blood “leaks” out 
into tissues. This happens in a mild form when a person ingests too much salt (water is 
retained in the blood and seeps out into tissues) and in a severe form when a person is 
burned in a fire. In this situation, albumin escapes from capillaries as a result of the burn 
injury. Then water cannot be held in the blood; it escapes through the skin, and blood 
volume drops. 
Globulins are another component of blood and one of the plasma proteins. There are 
alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The gamma globulins are immunoglobulins, which are 
antibodies that bind to and sometimes destroy antigens (foreign substances). Examples of 
immunoglobulin antibodies are IgG (found in high concentration in plasma) and IgA 
(found in breast milk, saliva, tears, and respiratory mucus). Other immunoglobulins 
are IgM, IgD, and IgE. Immunoglobulins are separated from other plasma proteins by 
electrophoresis. In this process, an electrical current passes through a solution of plasma. 
The different proteins in plasma separate as they migrate at different speeds to the source 
of the electricity. 
Plasmapheresis (-apheresis means to remove) is the process of separating plasma from 
cells and then removing the plasma from the patient. In plasmapheresis, the entire blood 
sample is spun in a centrifuge machine, and the plasma, being lighter in weight than the 
cells, moves to the top of the sample. 
Figure 13-7 reviews the composition of blood.

BLOOD TYPES 

Transfusions of whole blood (cells and plasma) are used to replace blood lost after injury, 
during surgery, or in severe shock. A patient who is severely anemic and needs only red 
blood cells will receive a transfusion of packed red cells (whole blood with most of the 
plasma removed). Human blood falls into four main types: A, B, AB, and O. These types 
are based on the antigens on red blood cells and antibodies found in each person’s serum 
(Table 13-2). 

There are harmful effects of transfusing blood from a donor of one blood type into a 
recipient who has blood of another blood type. Therefore, before blood is transfused, both 
the blood donor and the blood recipient are tested, to make sure that the transfused blood 
will be compatible with the recipient’s blood type. 


During transfusion, if blood is not 
compatible, then hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells) occurs. This may be followed by 
excessive clotting in blood vessels (disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC), which 
is a life-threatening condition. 
Besides A and B antigens, many other antigens are located on the surface of red blood 
cells. One of these is called the Rh factor (named because it was first found in the blood 
of a rhesus monkey). The term Rh positive (Rh+) refers to a person who is born with 
the Rh antigen on his or her red blood cells. An Rh negative (Rh.) person does not have 
the Rh antigen. See Chapter 4, page 118 for more information about the Rh factor. In 
clinical practice, blood types are named to indicate both Rh and ABO antigen status. If a 
woman has an A+ (A positive) blood type, for example, this means that she was born with 
both A antigen and Rh antigen on her red blood cells. If a man has a B. (B negative) blood 
type, this means he was born with the B antigen on his red blood cells but not Rh antigen. 

BLOOD CLOTTING 

Blood clotting, or coagulation, is a complicated process involving many different substances 
and chemical reactions. The final result (usually taking less than 15 minutes) is the 
formation of a fibrin clot from the plasma protein fibrinogen. The suffix -gen means giving 
rise to. Platelets are important in beginning the process following injury to tissues or blood 
vessels. The platelets become sticky and collect, or aggregate, at the site of injury. Then, in 
combination with tissue and clotting factors, plus calcium, prothrombin, and thrombin, 
fibrinogen is converted to fibrin to form a clot (Figure 13-8). One of the important clotting 
factors is factor VIII. It is missing in some people who are born with hemophilia. Other 
hemophiliacs are missing factor IX. 

Why Is Type O the Universal Donor? 


Type O blood does not contain A or B red cell antigens and therefore will not react with antibodies in any recipient’s 
bloodstream. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies present in type O blood become diluted in the recipient’s bloodstream and do not 
cause an adverse reaction.

The fibrin threads form the clot by trapping red blood cells (Figure 13-9 shows a red 
blood cell trapped by fibrin threads). Then the clot retracts into a tight ball, leaving behind 
a clear fluid called serum. Normally, clots (thrombi) do not form in blood vessels unless 
the vessel is damaged or the flow of blood is impeded. Anticoagulant substances in the 
blood inhibit blood clotting, so clots do not form. Heparin, produced by tissue cells 
(especially in the liver), is an example of an anticoagulant. Other drugs such as warfarin 
(Coumadin) are given to patients with thromboembolic diseases to prevent the formation 
of clots.

PATHOLOGY 

Any abnormal or pathologic condition of the blood generally is referred to as a blood 
dyscrasia (disease). The blood dyscrasias discussed in this section are organized in the 
following manner: diseases of red blood cells, disorders of blood clotting, diseases of white 
blood cells, and disease of the bone marrow. 

DISEASES OF RED BLOOD CELLS 

anemia 
Deficiency in erythrocytes or hemoglobin. 
The most common type of anemia is iron deficiency anemia; it is caused by a 
lack of iron, which is required for hemoglobin production (Figure 13-10). 

Other types of anemia include: 

1. aplastic anemia Failure of blood cell production in the bone marrow. 
The cause of most cases of aplastic anemia is unknown (idiopathic), but some have 
been linked to benzene exposure and to antibiotics such as chloramphenicol. 
Pancytopenia occurs when stem cells fail to produce leukocytes, platelets, 
and erythrocytes. Blood transfusions prolong life, allowing the marrow time to 
resume its normal functioning, and antibiotics control infections. Bone marrow 
transplantation and regimens of drugs that inhibit the immune system are 
successful treatments in cases in which spontaneous recovery is unlikely.

and shape. The red cells are normal in hemoglobin content (normochromic) and size (normocytic). B, Iron deficiency anemia. Many 
erythrocytes are small (microcytic) and have increased central pallor (hypochromic). Red cells in this slide show variation in size 
(anisocytosis) and shape (poikilocytosis).

Sickle Cell Anemia FIGURE 13-11 Normal red blood cells and the 

(hemoglobin concentration is low) (crescent-shaped, distorted, fragile cells) 

abnormal cells in several types of anemia. 

2. hemolytic anemia 
Reduction in red cells due to excessive destruction. 
One example of hemolytic anemia is congenital spherocytic anemia (hereditary 
spherocytosis). Instead of their normal biconcave shape, erythrocytes become 
spheroidal. This rounded shape makes them fragile and easily destroyed 
(hemolysis). Shortened red cell survival results in increased reticulocytes in blood 
as the bone marrow compensates for hemolysis of mature erythrocytes. Because 
the spleen destroys red cells, removal of the spleen usually improves this anemia. 
Figure 13-11 shows the altered shape of erythrocytes in hereditary spherocytosis. 

3. pernicious anemia 
Lack of mature erythrocytes caused by inability to absorb vitamin B12 
into the bloodstream. 
Vitamin B12 is necessary for the proper development and maturation of erythrocytes. 
Although vitamin B12 is a common constituent of food (liver, kidney, sardines, egg 
yolks, oysters), it cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream without the aid of a 
special substance called intrinsic factor that is normally found in gastric juice. 
People with pernicious anemia lack this factor in their gastric juice, and the result 
is unsuccessful maturation of red blood cells, with an excess of large, immature, 
and poorly functioning cells in the bone marrow and large, often oval red cells 
(macrocytes) in the circulation. Treatment is administration (via injection) of 
vitamin B12 for life. Figure 13-11 illustrates cells in pernicious anemia. Pernicious 
means ruinous or hurtful. 

4. sickle cell anemia 
Hereditary disorder of abnormal hemoglobin producing sickle-shaped 
erythrocytes and hemolysis. 
The crescent, or sickle, shape of the erythrocyte (see Figure 13-11) is caused by an 
abnormal type of hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) in the red cell. The distorted, fragile 
erythrocytes cannot pass through small blood vessels normally. This leads to 
thrombosis and infarction (local tissue death from ischemia). Signs and symptoms 
are arthralgias, acute attacks of abdominal pain, and ulcerations of the extremities. 
The genetic defect (presence of the hemoglobin S gene) is particularly prevalent 
in black persons of African or African American ancestry and appears with different 
degrees of severity. Individuals with the sickle cell trait inherit just one gene for 
the disorder and usually do not have symptoms. 



BLOOD SYSTEM 517 


5. thalassemia Inherited defect in ability to produce hemoglobin, leading to 
hypochromia. 
This condition, usually occurring in persons of Mediterranean background, 
manifests in varying forms and degrees of severity and usually leads to hypochromic 
anemia with diminished hemoglobin content in red cells (see Figure 13-11). 
Thalassa is a Greek word meaning sea. 
hemochromatosis Excess iron deposits throughout the body. 
Hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, skin pigmentation, diabetes, and cardiac failure may 
occur. 

polycythemia vera 
General increase in red blood cells (erythremia). 

Blood consistency is viscous (thick) because of greatly increased numbers of 
erythrocytes. The bone marrow is hyperplastic, and leukocytosis and thrombocytosis 
commonly accompany the increase in red blood cells. Treatment consists of 
reduction of red cell volume to normal levels by phlebotomy (removal of blood 
from a vein) and by suppressing blood cell production with myelotoxic drugs. 
Notice that that suffix here is -hemia, instead of -emia. 

DISORDERS OF BLOOD CLOTTING 

hemophilia 
Excessive bleeding caused by hereditary lack of blood clotting factors 
(factor VIII or IX) necessary for blood clotting. 

Although the platelet count of a hemophiliac patient is normal, deficiency in 
clotting factors (factor VIII or IX) results in a prolonged coagulation time. Patients 
with clotting factor deficiencies often bleed into weight-bearing joints, especially 
ankles and knees. See Figure 13-12. Treatment consists of administration of the 
deficient factor.

knees. (Courtesy Dr. G. Dolan, University Hospital, Nottingham, UK.) 



13 
518 BLOOD SYSTEM 

purpura 
Multiple pinpoint hemorrhages and accumulation of blood under the 
skin. 

Hemorrhages into the skin and mucous membranes produce red-purple 
discoloration of the skin. Petechiae are tiny purple or red flat spots appearing on 
the skin as a result of hemorrhages. Ecchymoses are larger blue or purplish 
patches on the skin (bruises) (Figure 13-13). Purpura can be caused by having too 
few platelets (thrombocytopenia). The cause may be immunologic, meaning the 
body produces an antiplatelet factor that harms its own platelets. Autoimmune 
thrombocytopenic purpura is a condition in which a patient makes an antibody 
that destroys platelets. Bleeding time is prolonged; splenectomy (the spleen is the 
site of platelet destruction) and drug therapy with corticosteroids are common 
treatments. 

DISEASES OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS 

leukemia 
Increase in cancerous white blood cells (leukocytes). 

Acute leukemias have common clinical characteristics: abrupt onset of symptoms, 
fatigue, fever, bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and 
hepatomegaly. If the disease has spread to the spinal canal, signs such as headache 
and vomiting may occur. In addition, because normal blood cells are crowded out, 
patients have little defense against infection. 

Four types of leukemia are: 

1. 
Acute myelogenous (myelocytic) leukemia (AML). Immature granulocytes 
(myeloblasts) predominate. Platelets and erythrocytes are diminished 
because of infiltration and replacement of the bone marrow by large numbers 
of myeloblasts (Figure 13-14A).

BLOOD SYSTEM 519

FIGURE 13-14 Acute leukemia. A, Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Myeloblasts (immature granulocytes) predominate. There 
are large cells with small granules in their cytoplasm. AML affects primarily adults. A majority of patients achieve remission with 
intensive chemotherapy, but relapse is common. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be a curative therapy. B, Acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Lymphoblasts (immature lymphocytes) predominate. ALL is a disease of children and young adults. 
Most children are cured with chemotherapy. (Courtesy Dr. Robert W. McKenna, Department of Pathology, University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical School, Dallas.)

 2. 
Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Immature lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) 
predominate. This form is seen most often in children and adolescents; onset 
is sudden (see Figure 13-14B). 
3. 
Chronic myelogenous (myelocytic) leukemia (CML). Both mature and 
immature granulocytes are present in large numbers in the marrow and 
blood. This is a slowly progressive illness with which patients (often adults 
older than 55) may live for many years without encountering life-threatening 
problems. New therapies (such as the drug Gleevec) target abnormal proteins 
responsible for malignancy and produce long-term control. 
4. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Abnormal numbers of relatively 
mature lymphocytes predominate in the marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. 
This most common form of leukemia usually occurs in the elderly and follows 
a slowly progressive course. It often does not require immediate treatment. 
All forms of leukemia are treated with chemotherapy, using drugs that prevent 
cell division and selectively injure rapidly dividing cells. Effective treatment can 
lead to a remission (disappearance of signs and symptoms of disease). Relapse 
occurs when disease symptoms and signs reappear, necessitating further treatment. 

Transplantation of normal bone marrow from donors of similar tissue type is 
successful in restoring normal bone marrow function in some patients with acute 
leukemia. This procedure is performed after high-dose chemotherapy, which is 
administered to eliminate the leukemic cells. 

granulocytosis 
Abnormal increase in granulocytes in the blood. 

An increase in neutrophils in the blood may occur in response to infection or 
inflammation of any type. Eosinophilia is an increase in eosinophilic granulocytes, 
seen in certain allergic conditions, such as asthma, or in parasitic infections 
(tapeworm, pinworm). Basophilia is an increase in basophilic granulocytes seen in 
certain types of leukemia.

mononucleosis Infectious disease marked by increased numbers of mononuclear 
leukocytes and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. 
This disease is transmitted by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Lymphadenitis 
is present, with fever, fatigue, asthenia (weakness), and pharyngitis. Atypical 
lymphocytes are present in the blood, liver, and spleen (leading to hepatomegaly 
and splenomegaly). 
Mononucleosis usually is transmitted by direct oral contact (salivary exchange 
during kissing) and affects primarily young adults. No treatment is necessary for 
EBV infections. Antibiotics are not effective for self-limited viral illnesses. Rest 
during the period of acute symptoms and slow return to normal activities are 
advised. 

DISEASE OF BONE MARROW CELLS 

multiple myeloma 
Malignant neoplasm of bone marrow. 

The malignant cells (lymphocytes that produce antibodies) destroy bone tissue 
and cause overproduction of immunoglobulins, including Bence Jones protein, 
an immunoglobulin fragment found in urine. The condition leads to osteolytic 
lesions, hypercalcemia, anemia, renal damage, and increased susceptibility 
to infection. Treatment is with analgesics, radiotherapy, various doses of 
chemotherapy, and special orthopedic supports. Drugs such as thalidomide and 
Velcade (bortezomib) are palliative (relieving symptoms) and stop disease 
progression, which improves the outlook for this disease. Autologous bone 
marrow transplantation (ABMT), in which the patient serves as his or her own 
donor for stem cells, may lead to prolonged remission. 

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

LABORATORY TESTS 

antiglobulin test (Coombs 
Test for the presence of antibodies that coat and damage erythrocytes. 

test) 
This test determines the presence of antibodies in infants of Rh-negative women 
or in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 

bleeding time 
Time required for blood to stop flowing from a tiny puncture wound. 

Normal time is 8 minutes or less. Either the Simplate or the Ivy method is used. 
Platelet disorders and the use of aspirin prolong bleeding time. 

coagulation time 
Time required for venous blood to clot in a test tube. 

Normal time is less than 15 minutes. 

complete blood count (CBC) 
Determination of numbers of blood cells, hemoglobin concentration, 
hematocrit, and red cell values—MCH, MCV, MCHC (see Abbreviations). 

erythrocyte sedimentation 
Speed at which erythrocytes settle out of plasma. 

rate (ESR) 
Venous blood is collected into an anticoagulant, and the blood is placed in a 
tube in a vertical position. The distance that the erythrocytes sink in a given 
period of time is the sedimentation rate. The rate increases with infections, joint 
inflammation, and tumor, which increase the fibrinogen content of the blood. Also 
called sed rate for short. 



BLOOD SYSTEM 521 


hematocrit (Hct) 
Percentage of erythrocytes in a volume of blood. 

A sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge so that the erythrocytes fall to the bottom 
of the sample. 

hemoglobin test Total amount of hemoglobin in a sample of peripheral blood. 
(H, Hg, Hgb, HGB) 

platelet count 
Number of platelets per cubic millimeter (mm3) or microliter (μL) of 
blood. 

Platelets normally average between 150,000 and 350,000 per mm3 (cu mm) or μL. 

prothrombin time (PT) 
Test of the ability of blood to clot. 

Prothrombin is one of the clotting factors (factor II) made by the liver. This test is 
used to monitor (follow) patients taking anticoagulant drugs. Another blood 
clotting test, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), measures other clotting factors. 
Both PT and PTT are often done at the same time to check for bleeding problems. 

red blood cell count (RBC) 
Number of erythrocytes per cubic millimeter (mm3) or microliter (μL) 
of blood. 

The normal number is 4 to 6 million per mm3 (or μL). 

red blood cell morphology 
Microscopic examination of a stained blood smear to determine the 
shape of individual red cells. 

Abnormal morphology includes anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and sickle cells. 

white blood cell count (WBC) 
Number of leukocytes per cubic millimeter (mm3) or microliter (μL) of 
blood. 

Automated counting devices record numbers within seconds. Normal number of 
leukocytes averages between 5000 and 10,000 per mm3 (or μL). 

white blood cell differential Percentages of different types of leukocytes in the blood. 
[count] Some instruments can produce an automated differential count, but otherwise the 
cells are stained and counted under a microscope by a technician. Percentages of 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and immature cells 
(bands) are determined. See page 526 for the normal differential values. 
The term shift to the left describes an increase in immature neutrophils in the 
blood. 


Shift to the Left 

The phrase “shift to the left” derives from the early practice of reporting percentages of each WBC type across the top of a 
page, starting with blasts (immature cells) on the left and more mature cells on the right. An increase in immature neutrophils 
(as seen with severe infection) would be noted on the left-hand column of a form. Thus a “shift to the left” indicates an infection 
and the body’s effort to fight it by making more neutrophils.

FIGURE 13-15 Leukapheresis. This machine is an 
automated blood cell separator that removes large 
numbers of white blood cells and returns red cells, 
platelets, and plasma to the patient. 

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

apheresis 
Separation of blood into component parts and removal of a select 
portion from the blood. 

This procedure can remove toxic substances or autoantibodies from the blood and 
can collect blood cells. Leukapheresis, plateletpheresis, and plasmapheresis are 
examples (Figure 13-15). If plasma is removed from the patient and fresh plasma 
is given, the procedure is termed plasma exchange. 

blood transfusion 
Whole blood or cells are taken from a donor and infused into a patient. 

Appropriate testing to ensure a match of red blood cell type (A, B, AB, or O) 
is essential. Tests also are performed to detect the presence of hepatitis and 
the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus (HIV). Autologous 
transfusion is the collection and later reinfusion of a patient’s own blood or blood 
components. Packed cells are a preparation of red blood cells separated from 
liquid plasma and administered in severe anemia to restore levels of hemoglobin 
and red cells without overdiluting the blood with excess fluid. 

bone marrow biopsy 
Microscopic examination of a core of bone marrow removed with a 
needle. 

This procedure is helpful in the diagnosis of blood disorders such as anemia, 
pancytopenias, and leukemia. Bone marrow also may be removed by brief suction 
produced by a syringe, which is termed a bone marrow aspiration. See Figure 
13-16. 

hematopoietic stem cell Peripheral stem cells from a compatible donor are administered to a 
transplantation recipient. 

Patients with malignancies, such as AML, ALL, CLL, CML, lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma, are candidates for this treatment. First the donor is treated with a drug 
that mobilizes stem cells into the blood. Then stem cells are removed from the 
donor, a process like leukapheresis in Figure 13-15. Meanwhile, the patient 
(recipient) undergoes a conditioning process in which radiation and chemotherapy 
drugs are administered to kill malignant marrow cells and inactivate the patient’s 
immune system so that subsequently infused stem cells will not be rejected. A cell 
suspension containing the donor’s stem cells, which will repopulate the bone 
marrow, is then given through a vein to the recipient. In autologous stem cell 
transplantation, the patient’s own stem cells are collected, stored, and reinfused 
after potent chemotherapy. See the In Person story, page 528.

crest (upper portion of hipbone) and aspiration of liquid bone marrow. B, Trephine needle is then inserted and 
anchored in the bone. C, A solid piece of bone marrow (biopsy sample) is then extracted through the needle. 

Bone marrow transplantation follows the same procedure, except that bone 
marrow cells are used rather than peripheral stem cells (Figure 13-17). Problems 
encountered subsequently may include serious infection, graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD), and relapse of the original disease despite the treatment. 

In GVHD, the immunocompetent cells in the donor’s tissue recognize the 
recipient’s tissues as foreign and attack them. Because the recipient patient 
is totally immunosuppressed, his or her immune system cannot defend against 
the attack. Intensive prophylaxis (prevention) with immunosuppressive drugs is 
standard for patients undergoing allogeneic transplants (see Figure 13-17). These 
drugs include cyclosporine and methotrexate.

as GVHD (graft-versus-host disease). In an autologous transplantation, stem cells or bone marrow cells are removed from the 
patient during a remission phase and given back to the patient after intensive chemotherapy (drug treatment).

IN PERSON 
This is a first-person account of a woman undergoing an autologous 
stem cell transplant. 

I was scheduled for a stem cell transplant to cure my recurrent primary 
central nervous system lymphoma, or PCNSL, a rare type of brain cancer. 
Until around fifteen years ago, stem cell transplants depended upon bone 
marrow from which to harvest the cells. Since then, scientists have 
discovered that there are actually more cells available in peripheral 
(circulating) blood than in marrow. Two medicines, Mozobil and 
Neupogen, aimed at stimulating enough stem cells to be collected from 
that peripheral source. Now, to prepare for my transplant, my daughter 
took me to Memorial Sloan-Kettering four consecutive nights for a 
Mozobil shot. Eight hours later, I had to return, after giving myself 
a Neupogen injection. In a peripheral autologous blood stem cell 
transplant, stem cells are collected from the circulating blood by 
apheresis, in which blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle, and 
passed through a machine that harvests stem cells into a container, 
while the remaining blood components are then transferred back into 


13 
the patient’s bloodstream. The fraction containing the blood stem cells 
is then frozen until needed for transplantation. Because patients get their own cells back, no chance exists for 
immune mismatch or graft-versus-host problems. 

“Your blood has circulated through your body once—it takes an hour,” the nurse explained that first day. “It 
will go around twice more, to sweep up all the stem cells it can, then you’ll be done till tomorrow morning.” 
That first day, I produced half of the total stem cells I would need for my treatment, emboldening me to make 
plans to return home after the next session. Instead, my collection slowed down and I squeezed out only 
another quarter of the necessary supply. I made enough stem cells the third day to reach the magic number, 
and was able to go home and wait for the hospital to call and say they’d scheduled me into their transplant 
schedule. A representative phoned two days later, laying out the next five weeks for me: I’d be admitted in 
eleven days to the transplant division, where I would remain, they hoped, for no more than a month. My 
(presumably clean) stem cells were safely stored in a freezer while I was to undergo intensive chemotherapy 
meant to destroy any lurking cancer cells in my brain (and of course, benign others in the medicine’s take-noprisoners 
path). 



BLOOD SYSTEM 529 


I was glad when the date arrived, and my husband Dennis moved me into my next month’s home on the 
eighth floor of MSK, where we cheerfully commented on my having freedom to read as much as I wanted. I 
loved solitude, and I had so many books, loaded conveniently on my Kindle, that I planned to devour. What 
I had failed to understand is the nature of an autologous stem cell transplant, at least for primary CNS 
lymphoma. I was to be blasted, rendered helpless, with a trio of chemo agents able to pass through the 
blood-brain barrier, but not ordinarily available for treatment-as-a-threesome due to their combined 
viciousness: busulfan, thiotepa (mustard gas related), and cyclophosphamide (also a nitrogen mustard 
alkylating agent). I could risk receiving these killers because my uncontaminated stem cells were stored in the 
freezer. They would eventually replace my currently circulating blood that was being saturated with 
chemotherapy agents. 

After nine days, my white blood count showed I was as low as I could go: I was at ground zero, “my second 
birthday.” The blood we’d collected with the help of Mozobil and company was slowly thawed, for a few hours, 
and soon I was given a transfusion of my previously frozen blood, swarming with stem cells. Before long, I felt 
so sick I thought I was dying. Wearing diapers that had to be changed every twenty minutes, having rectal 
samples taken from my chafed, sometimes bloody “toilet skin” (as the nurse called it), being forced to sit up 
every minute, even at night, so that I could put the suction tube down my throat to keep from drowning in the 
rope-like mucositis, which ulcerated the membranes lining my digestive system. I could go on and on. 

But as I’d been promised, nearly five weeks post-admission for the life-giving stem cell transplant, I was 
deemed ready to go home. For a month, however, our house operated like a medical office. That first week, I 
kept down half a shake a day. When I returned to Memorial for my first checkup, I had to stay an extra five 
hours for a hydration infusion. Four days later, my red blood count was low and I needed a transfusion— 
perfectly typical, Craig said cheerfully. By the second week, I’d started eating Cheerios with milk throughout 
the day, and my weight at least stabilized. I no longer looked like a skeleton. 

At 100 days post-transplant, we could make love again. I worried that Dennis would find my scrawniness a 
turnoff, but he quickly forgot my new boy’s body and enthusiastically helped me recapture my faith in our 
oneness. After all, we’d been through the battle and needed now to smell the perennial flowers. Turns out 
they’re as colorful as ever.

6. Juan was a 9-year-old boy who suddenly noticed many black and blue marks all over his legs. He 
had a fever and was tired all the time. The physician did a blood test that revealed pancytopenia. A 
bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of (acute lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, 
aplastic anemia). 
7. Alice and her friends had been staying up late for weeks, cramming for exams. She developed a sore 
throat and swollen lymph nodes in her neck and felt fatigued all the time. Dr. Smith did a blood 
test, and the results showed lymphocytosis and antibodies to EBV in the bloodstream. His 
diagnosis was (leukapheresis, lymphocytopenia, mononucleosis). 
8. Susan was experiencing heavy menstrual periods (menorrhea, menorrhagia, hemoptysis). Because 
of the bleeding, she frequently felt tired and weak and probably was sideropenic. Her physician 
performed blood tests that revealed her problem as (thrombocytopenia, pernicious anemia, iron 
deficiency anemia). 
9. Dr. Harris examined a highly allergic patient and sent a blood sample to a specialist, a (pulmonary, 
cardiovascular, hematologic) pathologist. The specialist stained the blood smear and found an 
abundance of leukocytes with dense, reddish granules. She made the diagnosis of (basophilia, 
eosinophilia, neutrophilia). 
10. George’s blood cell counts had been falling in recent weeks. His scheduled laparotomy was 
canceled because blood tests revealed (pancytopenia, plasmapheresis, myelopoiesis). Bone marrow 
biopsy determined that the cause was (hyperplasia, hypoplasia, differentiation) of all cellular

546 LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 


INTRODUCTION 


The lymphatic system and the immune system are considered together in this chapter 

because aspects of their functions in the body are very closely related. 
Lymph is a clear, watery fluid that surrounds body cells and flows in a system of thin-

walled lymph vessels (the lymphatic system) that extends throughout the body. 

Lymph differs from blood, but it has a close relationship to the blood system. Lymph fluid 
does not contain erythrocytes or platelets, but it is rich in two types of white blood cells 
(leukocytes): lymphocytes and monocytes. The liquid part of lymph is similar to blood 
plasma in that it contains water, salts, sugar, and wastes of metabolism such as urea and 
creatinine, but it differs in that it contains less protein. Lymph actually originates from the 
blood. It is the same fluid that filters out of tiny blood capillaries into the spaces between 
cells. This fluid that surrounds body cells is called interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid passes 
continuously into specialized thin-walled vessels called lymph capillaries, which are found 
coursing through tissue spaces (Figure 14-1). The fluid in the lymph capillaries, now called 
lymph instead of interstitial fluid, passes through larger lymphatic vessels and through 
clusters of lymph tissues (lymph nodes), finally reaching large lymphatic vessels in the 
upper chest. Lymph enters these large lymphatic vessels, which then empty into the 
bloodstream. Figure 14-2 illustrates schematically the relationship between the blood and 
the lymphatic systems. Table 14-1 reviews the differences between lymph and blood. 

The lymphatic system has several functions. First, it is a drainage system to transport 
needed proteins and fluid that have leaked out of the blood capillaries (and into the 
interstitial fluid) back to the bloodstream via the veins. Second, the lymphatic vessels in the 
intestines absorb lipids (fats) from the small intestine and transport them to the bloodstream. 

A third function of the lymphatic system relates to the immune system: the defense 
of the body against foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Lymphocytes and 
monocytes, originating in bone marrow, lymph nodes, and organs such as the spleen and 
thymus gland, protect the body by producing antibodies and by mounting a cellular attack 
on foreign cells and organisms.

ANATOMY 

Label Figure 14-3A as you read the following paragraphs. 

Lymph capillaries [1] begin at the spaces around cells throughout the body. Like blood 
capillaries, they are thin-walled tubes. Lymph capillaries carry lymph from the tissue spaces 
to larger lymph vessels [2]. Lymph vessels have thicker walls than those of lymph capillaries 
and, like veins, contain valves so that lymph flows in only one direction, toward the thoracic 
cavity. Collections of stationary lymph tissue, called lymph nodes [3], are located along the 
path of the lymph vessels.

LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 549 


Major sites of lymph node concentration are shown in Figure 14-3A. These are the 
cervical (neck) [4], axillary (armpit) [5], mediastinal (chest) [6], mesenteric (intestinal) [7], 
paraaortic (lumbar) [8], and inguinal (groin) [9] regions. Remember that tonsils are masses 
of lymph tissue in the throat near the back of the mouth (oropharynx), and adenoids are 
enlarged lymph tissue in the part of the throat near the nasal passages (nasopharynx). 

Lymph vessels all lead toward the thoracic cavity and empty into two large ducts in the 
upper chest. These are the right lymphatic duct [10] and the thoracic duct [11]. The thoracic 
duct drains the lower body and the left side of the head, whereas the right lymphatic duct 
drains the right side of the head and the chest (a much smaller area) (see Figure 14-3B). 
Both ducts carry the lymph into large veins [12] in the neck, where the lymph then enters 
the bloodstream. 

Lymph nodes not only produce lymphocytes but also filter lymph and trap substances 
from infectious, inflammatory, and cancerous lesions. Special cells called macrophages, 
located in lymph nodes (as well as in the spleen, liver, and lungs), swallow (phagocytose) 
foreign substances. When bacteria are present in lymph nodes that drain a particular area 
of the body, the nodes become swollen with collections of cells and their engulfed debris 
and become tender. Lymph nodes also fight disease when specialized lymphocytes called 
B lymphocytes (B cells), which are present in the nodes, produce antibodies. Other 
lymphocytes present in nodes are T lymphocytes (T cells). They attack bacteria and 
foreign cells by accurately recognizing a cell as foreign and destroying it. (See Figure 14-4.) 
B cells mature in bone marrow, while T cells originate in the thymus gland.

SPLEEN AND THYMUS GLAND 

The spleen and the thymus gland are specialized organs that are also a part of the lymphatic 
system. 

The spleen (Figure 14-5A) is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, next to 
the stomach. Although the spleen is not essential to life, it has several important functions:

 1. 
Destruction of old erythrocytes by macrophages. In the slow-moving circulation of 
the spleen, red cell breakdown (hemolysis) liberates hemoglobin, which is converted to 
bilirubin in the liver and then is excreted into the bile. 
2. 
Filtration of microorganisms and other foreign material from the blood. 
3. 
Activation of lymphocytes. Activated B lymphocytes (B cells) produce antibodies. 
Activated T lymphocytes (T cells) attack foreign materials. 
4. 
Storage of blood, especially erythrocytes and platelets. 
The spleen is susceptible to injury. A sharp blow to the upper abdomen (as from the 
impact of a car’s steering wheel) may cause rupture of the spleen. Massive hemorrhage can 
occur when the spleen is ruptured, and immediate surgical removal (splenectomy) may 
be necessary. After splenectomy, the liver, bone marrow, and lymph nodes take over the 
functions of the spleen. 

The thymus gland (see Figure 14-5B) is a lymphatic organ located in the upper 
mediastinum between the lungs. During fetal life and childhood it is quite large, but it 
becomes smaller with age. The thymus gland is composed of nests of lymphoid cells resting 
on a platform of connective tissue. It plays an important role in the body’s ability to protect 
itself from disease (immunity), especially in fetal life and during the early years of growth. 
It is known that a thymectomy (removal of the thymus gland) performed in an animal 
during the first weeks of life impairs the ability of the animal to make antibodies and to 
produce immune cells that fight against foreign antigens such as bacteria and viruses. 
Thus, the thymus gland is important in development of an effective immune system in 
childhood. 

Early in development, in the thymus, lymphocytes learn to recognize and accept the 
body’s own antigens as “self” or friendly. This acceptance of “self” antigens is called tolerance. 
When the tolerance process fails, immune cells react against normal cells, resulting 
in various pathologic conditions (autoimmune disease). See page 556, under autoimmune 
disease (aut/o = self). 



LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 551 


IMMUNE SYSTEM 

The immune system is specialized to defend the body against antigens (such as toxins, 
bacterial proteins, or foreign blood cells). This system includes leukocytes such as 
neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, which are phagocytes found in blood and 
tissues throughout the body. In addition, lymphoid organs, such as the lymph nodes, 
spleen, thymus gland, tonsils, and adenoids, produce lymphocytes and antibodies. 

NATURAL AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY 

Immunity is the body’s ability to resist foreign organisms and toxins that damage tissues 
and organs. Natural immunity is resistance present at birth. It is not dependent on prior 
exposure to an antigen (infectious agent). An example of natural immunity is after a 
bacterial infection, white blood cells respond immediately to the intruding antigens. 
Neutrophils travel to the infected area and ingest bacteria. Other white blood cells, such as 
monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes (NK or natural killer cells), also participate in 
the body’s natural immunity against infection. 

In addition to natural immunity, a healthy person can develop adaptive immunity. This 
is the body’s ability to recognize and remember specific antigens in an immune response. 
Lymphocytes (T and B cells) are part of adaptive immunity. T cells recognize and remember 
specific antigens and produce stronger attacks each time the antigen is encountered. 
B cells secrete antibodies against antigens. Think of what happens when you have a cold or 
the flu. You are exposed to a viral antigen. Your B cells secrete antibodies, which not only 
destroy the virus but remain in the blood so that when the virus reappears, at a later time, 
you have adaptive immunity to it! Another example of adaptive immunity is vaccination. 
You are given an injection of a killed virus (for example, poliovirus) that doesn’t make you 
ill, but stimulates your B cells to secrete antibodies against that virus so that if you are 
exposed to it at a later time, you will have adaptive immunity. 

There are instances when more immediate adaptive immunity is necessary. Poisons 
(toxins) that rapidly cause major damage (for example, snake venom) can be counteracted 
by giving ready-made antibodies, called antitoxins, produced in another organism. 
Injections of ready-made antibodies, such as immunoglobulins, can boost your adaptive 
immunity before you travel to a foreign country. Infants are given adaptive immunity when 
they receive maternal antibodies through the placenta or breast milk. Figure 14-6 reviews 
the general differences between natural and adaptive immunity.

FIGURE 14-7 Humoral immunity: B cell, plasma cell, and immunoglobulins. 

Adaptive immunity has two components: humoral immunity and cell-mediated 
immunity. Humoral immunity involves B cells (B lymphocytes), while cell-mediated 
immunity involves T cells (T lymphocytes). In humoral immunity, B cells produce 
antibodies after exposure to specific antigens (viruses and bacteria). This is what happens: 
The B cell matures into another cell called a plasma cell. It is the plasma cell that produces 
antibodies called immunoglobulins, which block the effects of antigens. Examples of 
immunoglobulins (Ig = immunoglobulin) are IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE, and IgD. One maternal 
immunoglobulin, IgG, crosses the placenta to provide immunity for newborns. Another, 
IgE, is important in allergic reactions and in fighting parasitic infections. Figure 14-7 
reviews the relationship of a B cell, plasma cell, and immunoglobulins in humoral 
immunity. 

Cell-mediated immunity does not involve antibodies. Rather, it involves several types of 
T cells with different functions. For example, cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) attach to 
antigens and directly kill them. Cytotoxic cells also secrete cytokines (interferons and 
interleukins), which aid other cells in antigen destruction. Helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) 
assist B cells in making antibodies and they stimulate T cells to attack antigens. Suppressor 
T cells (also called regulatory T cells or Tregs) inhibit both B and T cells and prevent them 
from attacking the body’s own good cells. Figure 14-8 reviews the types of T cells in 
cell-mediated immunity. 

The adaptive immune system is helped by a number of other proteins and cells found in 
circulating blood. One of these is the complement system, a group of proteins that helps 
antibodies kill their target. Another warrior is the dendritic cell, which initiates adaptive 
immunity by presenting antigens to T and B cells, showing them precisely what they need 
to counteract. A number of cell types can present antigens to T cells, but dendritic cells are 
especially efficient at this task. Figure 14-9 reviews the roles of B cells, T cells, complement, 
and dendritic cells.

IMMUNOTHERAPY 

Immunotherapy is the use of antibodies, B cells (producing antibodies), and T cells to treat 
disease such as cancer. Types of immunotherapy are: 

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAb)—These are antibodies created in a laboratory by special 
reproductive (cloning) techniques. They are designed to attack specific cancer cells. An 
example of monoclonal antibody therapy is the drug rituximab (Rituxan), made to kill 
malignant lymphoma cells. The antibody may be linked to various toxins or radioactive 
particles and delivered to tumor cells, to enhance the killing effect. 

Vaccines—These preparations contain antigens (proteins) from a patient’s tumor cells. 
When they are injected, they stimulate the patient’s own T cells to recognize and kill the 
cancerous cells. Vaccines may be injected or given as a nasal spray. 

Transfer of immune cells—In bone marrow transplantation, T lymphocytes from a 
donor can replace a patient’s immune system with new cells that recognize tumor cells as 
foreign and kill them. 

Monoclonal antibodies and transfer of immune cells are passive immunotherapy 
(immune agents are given to the patient), while vaccination is active immunotherapy (the 
patient’s own immune system is stimulated to do the work).

PATHOLOGY 

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 

Some immunodeficiency disorders are present at birth. An example is severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease (SCID). Affected infants are born with a deficiency of B cells and T cells, resulting in a lack of immunity. 
The thymus is small, and children have little or no protection against infection. 

acquired immunodeficiency Group of clinical signs and symptoms associated with suppression of 
syndrome (AIDS) the immune system and marked by opportunistic infections, secondary 

neoplasms, and neurologic problems. 
AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV destroys helper 
T cells (also known as CD4+ 
cells, containing the CD4 protein antigen). This 
disrupts the immune response, allowing infections to occur. Infectious diseases 
associated with AIDS are called opportunistic infections because HIV lowers 
resistance and allows infection by bacteria and parasites that are easily otherwise 
contained by normal defenses. Table 14-2 lists many of these opportunistic 
infections; use the table as a reference.

TABLE 14-2 OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS WITH AIDS 
Infection Description 

candidiasis Yeast-like fungus (Candida), normally present in the mouth, skin, intestinal 
tract, and vagina, overgrows, causing infection of the mouth (thrush), 
respiratory tract, and skin. 

cryptococcal infection (Crypto) Yeast-like fungus (Cryptococcus) causes lung, brain, and blood infections. 
Pathogen is found in pigeon droppings and nesting places, air, water, 
and soil. 
cryptosporidiosis Parasitic infection of the gastrointestinal tract and brain and spinal cord. 
The pathogen, Cryptosporidium, is a one-celled organism commonly 
found in farm animals. 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection Virus causes enteritis and retinitis (inflammation of the retina at the back 
of the eye). Found in saliva, semen, cervical secretions, urine, feces, 
blood, and breast milk, but usually causes disease only when the 
immune system is compromised. 
herpes simplex Viral infection causes small blisters on the skin of the lips or nose or on 
the genitals. Herpes simplex virus also can cause encephalitis. 
histoplasmosis (Histo) Fungal infection caused by inhalation of dust contaminated with 
Histoplasma capsulatum; causes fever, chills, and lung infection. 
Pathogen is found in bird and bat droppings. 
Mycobacterium avium-
intracellulare (MAI) complex 
infection 
Bacterial disease manifesting with fever, malaise, night sweats, anorexia, 
diarrhea, weight loss, and lung and blood infections. 
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) One-celled organism causes lung infection, with fever, cough, and chest 
pain. Pathogen is found in air, water, and soil and is carried by animals. 
Infection is treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), a 
combination of antibiotics, or with pentamidine. Aerosolized 
pentamidine, which is inhaled, can prevent occurrence of PCP. 
toxoplasmosis (Toxo) Parasitic infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) and causing 
fever, chills, visual disturbances, confusion, hemiparesis (slight paralysis 
in half of the body), and seizures. Pathogen (Toxoplasma) is acquired by 
eating uncooked lamb or pork, unpasteurized dairy products, or raw 
eggs or vegetables. 
14 
tuberculosis (TB) Bacterial disease (caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis) involving the 
lungs, brain, and other organs. Signs and symptoms are fever, cough, 
loss of weight, anorexia, and blood in sputum. 

Malignancies associated with AIDS are Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer arising 
from the lining cells of capillaries that produces dark purplish skin nodules) and 
lymphoma (cancer of lymph nodes). Wasting syndrome, marked by weight loss 
and decrease in muscular strength, appetite, and mental activity, also may occur 
with AIDS (Figure 14-11A and B). 

Persons who were exposed to HIV and now have antibodies in their blood 
against this virus are HIV-positive. HIV is found in blood, semen, vaginal and 
cervical secretions, saliva, and other body fluids. Transmission of HIV may occur 
by three routes: sexual contact, blood inoculation (through sharing of contaminated 
needles, accidental needlesticks, or contact with contaminated blood or blood 
products), and passage of the virus from infected mothers to their newborns. Table 
14-3 summarizes the common routes of transmission of HIV. 



LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 559 


AA B
FIGURE 14-11 A, Kaposi sarcoma. B, Wasting 
syndrome. 

HIV-infected patients may remain asymptomatic for as long as 10 years. Signs 
and symptoms associated with HIV infection are lymphadenopathy, neurologic 
disease, oral thrush (fungal infection), night sweats, fatigue, and evidence of 
opportunistic infections. 

Some drugs that are used to treat AIDS are inhibitors of the viral enzyme called 
reverse transcriptase (RT). After invading the helper T cell (carrying the CD4+ 
antigen), HIV releases reverse transcriptase to help it grow and multiply inside 
the cell. Examples of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are zidovudine and 
lamivudine (Epivir). A second class of anti-HIV drugs is the protease inhibitors. 
These drugs inhibit another viral enzyme called protease. HIV needs protease to 
reproduce. Use of combinations of protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, amprenavir) and 
RTIs is called HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). This treatment has in 
many cases abolished evidence of viral infection in affected people.

HYPERSENSITIVITY 
allergy Abnormal hypersensitivity acquired by exposure to an antigen. 
Allergic (all/o = other) reactions occur when a sensitized person, who has 
previously been exposed to an agent (allergen), reacts violently to a subsequent 
exposure. This reaction varies in intensity from allergic rhinitis or hay fever 
(caused by pollen or animal dander) to systemic anaphylaxis, in which an 
extraordinary hypersensitivity reaction occurs throughout the body, leading to fall 
in blood pressure (hypotension), shock, respiratory distress, and edema (swelling) 
of the larynx. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, but the patient usually survives 
if the airways are kept open and treatment is given immediately (epinephrine and 
antihistamines). 
Other allergies include asthma (pollens, dust, molds), hives (caused by food 
or drugs), and atopic dermatitis (rash from soaps, cosmetics, chemicals). Atopic 
means related to atopy, a hypersensitivity or allergic state arising from an 
inherited predisposition. A person who is atopic is prone to allergies (Figure 
14-12). 
MALIGNANCIES 
lymphoma Malignant tumor of lymph nodes and lymph tissue. 
There are many types of lymphoma, varying according to the particular cell type 
and degree of differentiation. Some examples are: 
Hodgkin disease—Malignant tumor of lymphoid tissue in the spleen and lymph 
nodes. This disease is characterized by lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes enlarge), 
splenomegaly, fever, weakness, and loss of weight and appetite. The diagnosis often 
is made by identifying a malignant cell (Reed-Sternberg cell) in the lymph nodes. 
If disease is localized, the treatment may be radiotherapy or chemotherapy. If the 
disease is more widespread, chemotherapy is given alone. There is a very high 
probability of cure with available treatments. Figure 14-13 illustrates staging of 
Hodgkin disease.

FIGURE 14-12 Atopic dermatitis. 



LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 561 
14 Non-Hodgkin lymphomas—These include follicular lymphoma (composed of 
collections of small lymphocytes in a follicle or nodule arrangement) and large 
cell lymphoma (composed of large lymphocytes that infiltrate nodes and tissues 
diffusely). Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are mostly B cell lymphomas and rarely T cell 
malignancies. Chemotherapy may cure or stop the progress of this disease. 
multiple myeloma Malignant tumor of bone marrow cells. 
This is a tumor composed of plasma cells (antibody-producing B lymphocytes) 
associated with high levels of one of the specific immunoglobulins, usually IgG. 
Waldenstr.m macroglobulinemia is another disorder of malignant B cells. This 
disease involves B cells that produce large quantities of IgM (a globulin of high 
molecular weight). Increased IgM concentration impairs the passage of blood 
through capillaries in the brain and eyes, causing a hyperviscosity syndrome 
(thickening of the blood). 
thymoma Malignant tumor of the thymus gland. 
Often thymoma is associated with a neuromuscular disorder, myasthenia gravis. 
Many patients with thymoma have other associated autoimmune disorders such 
as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Surgery is the principal method of treating thymoma; postoperative radiation 
therapy is used for patients with evidence of spread of the tumor.

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 


LABORATORY TESTS 
CD4+ cell count Measures the number of CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) in the 
bloodstream of patients with AIDS. 
A normal count usually is between 500 and 1500 CD4+ cells per mm3. If the CD4+ 
count falls below 250 to 200, it is recommended to start treatment with anti-HIV 
drugs. 
ELISA Screening test to detect anti-HIV antibodies in the bloodstream. 
Antibodies to HIV begin to appear within 2 weeks of infection with HIV. If the 
result of this test is positive, it is confirmed with a Western blot test, which is 
more specific. ELISA is an abbreviation for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 



LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS 563 


immunoelectrophoresis Test that separates immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IgE, IgA, IgD). 
This procedure detects the presence of abnormal levels of antibodies in patients 
with conditions such as multiple myeloma and Waldenstr.m macroglobulinemia. 
viral load test Measurement of the amount of AIDS virus (HIV) in the bloodstream. 
Two viral load tests are a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay and an NASBA

MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY IN SENTENCES 

1. In addition to the opportunistic infections and malignancies that typically characterize AIDS, pathology 
of the CNS occurs with some regularity. Specifically, CNS lymphomas, encephalitis, meningitis, 
progressive leukoencephalopathy, toxoplasmosis, and myelitis have been reported in patients with HIV 
infection. Dementia and delirium [clouding of consciousness] also have been reported as psychiatric 
complications. 
2. Protease inhibitors interrupt HIV replication, blocking an enzyme called protease. When protease is 
blocked, HIV cannot infect new cells. Protease inhibitors can reduce HIV viral load in the blood and 
increase CD4+ T cell counts. Examples of protease inhibitors are indinavir (Crixivan) and nelfinavir 
(Viracept). 
3. Lymph nodes that are nontender and rock-hard are suggestive of a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. 
4. Infectious mononucleosis and Hodgkin disease are more common in young adults, whereas non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are more common in middle-aged and elderly 
people. 
5. Oral candidiasis (thrush) manifesting without a history of recent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or 
immunosuppression may indicate the possibility of HIV infection or diabetes.

SHORT CLINICAL CASES 

Circle the correct answer for the diagnosis. 

1. John was healthy until the age of 22 months, when he developed angioedema [swelling induced while 
eating a cookie containing peanut butter]. The symptoms disappeared in about an hour. A month later, 
while eating the same type of cookie, he started to vomit, became hoarse, had great difficulty in 
breathing, started to wheeze, and developed a swollen face. He was taken immediately to the ED of 
Children’s Hospital, where he was given a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine [adrenaline]. Within 
minutes of the epinephrine injection, John’s hoarseness decreased, the wheezing diminished, and his 
breathing was less labored. His parents were advised to avoid giving him foods containing peanuts in 
any form. 
Diagnosis: (multiple myeloma, acute systemic anaphylaxis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) 

2. Mark Scott is a 48-year-old band leader who has always been in good health. Six months ago he went 
to the ED at the local hospital complaining of fever and a swollen right hand from a cat scratch. He 
was admitted to the hospital for the hand infection. His blood lymphocyte count was very low, so a 
blood sample was sent to be tested for antibodies against HIV. Both ELISA and a Western blot revealed 
presence of anti-HIV antibodies. His CD4+ T-cell count was very low at 170 [normal is 500-1600]. Mr. 
Scott told his doctor that he had several homosexual encounters before his marriage. His physician 
prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, and 
Mark also was given HAART. After 5 weeks of therapy, his HIV viral load declined to undetectable levels 
and his CD4+ T cell count rose. He remains well and active and works full time. 
Diagnosis: (T cell lymphoma, severe combined immunodeficiency disease, acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome) 

3. Mrs. Archer is a 55-year-old housewife who began to experience excessive fatigue. A blood sample 
revealed mild anemia and slightly lowered white blood cell count. Her sedimentation rate was elevated, 
and electrophoresis of serum proteins showed marked elevation of IgG. She returned for regular 
visits to her physician, and on each occasion serum IgG levels were gradually increasing. After she 
experienced sudden onset of upper back pain, a thoracic spine MRI study was performed and showed 
destruction of a portion of a vertebra. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of 
plasma cells. She was given chemotherapy (vincristine, Adriamycin, and Decadron), but a year later 
she developed fever and chest pain. Chest x-ray revealed pneumonia, and antibiotics were given. Her 
outlook for survival is poor. 
Diagnosis: (Hodgkin disease, hemolytic anemia, multiple myeloma)

IN PERSON 
This is written by a medical oncologist who specializes in the 
treatment of lymphoma patients. 

Of the many challenges of practicing medical oncology, the treatment of 
patients with lymphoma is among the most satisfying, and at times, 
most difficult. Lymphomas were the first common solid tumor to 
become curable with drugs alone. In 1969, investigators at the National 
Cancer Institute published their promising results with combination 
chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease. At that time, this was a tumor that 
was only treatable and curable with radiation therapy in a limited fraction 
of patients, when disease involved only a few lymph nodes. Very soon 
thereafter, chemotherapy proved curative for almost half of patients with 
a more aggressive disease (large B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma), a 
malignancy that affects 20,000 new subjects every year in the USA. In 
succeeding years, for patients not cured with conventional drugs, bone 
marrow transplant following ultra-high dose chemotherapy salvaged at 
least half of those patients who experienced a relapse of disease. New 


14 
drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies that attack proteins on the 
surface of tumors and initiate immune destruction of tumors, have added to that success. Thus, at present, by 
using chemotherapy, irradiation, and high-dose drug treatment, most lymphoma patients can be cured. 

The experience of treating a lymphoma patient is not simple. It requires, first of all, making the correct 
diagnosis, which requires obtaining an adequate biopsy of the involved lymph nodes, bone marrow, or other 
disease sites. Secondly, the physician in charge of the case must establish the sites and extent of disease, and 
this requires sophisticated x-ray and even MR imaging of lungs, abdomen, bones, and even spinal canal. The 
choice of drug regimens and other treatment depend on making a correct assessment of these factors. 

The doctor must explain all this to the patient so that he or she has a clear understanding of what lies ahead. 
This involves hospital outpatient visits for evaluation and treatment, including possible biopsy and repeat 
biopsy of sites of disease to establish whether the tumor has been effectively treated. I also spend considerable 
time with patients explaining the potential side effects of treatments, some of which can affect the lungs, 
heart, and immune system. In addition, patients need guidance following chemotherapy about susceptibility 
to serious infections when blood counts are low. Overall, the psychological stress and uncertainty of outcome 
plus the impact on work and family responsibilities make the need for support from friends and family crucial. 

For most patients, all of these issues are successfully managed during treatment, and no experience is more 
gratifying for me, as an oncologist, than to achieve cure of a potentially lethal disease. All of this is accomplished 
at a price. For a few patients, the stresses of disease and its impact on family and work prove overwhelming. I 
call upon the intervention of social workers, nurses, and even psychiatrists to help my patients deal with the 
difficulty of disease and life-changing experiences. The added rigors of bone marrow transplantation increase 
the burden on patients who are not cured by conventional treatments. And, even more stressful and challenging 
are those patients, a minority to be sure, whose disease progresses despite all interventions, and who are 
destined not to survive. For these patients, experimental treatments at times are the best option, and again 
may reverse the downward course. Through it all, as a physician, I find that we must all work as a team to 
provide the best medical advice, psychological support, and hope for 60,000 new patients who develop 
lymphoma each year.

INTRODUCTION 

The musculoskeletal system includes the bones, muscles, and joints. All have important 
functions in the body. 

Bones provide the framework on which the body is constructed and protect and support 
internal organs. Bones also assist the body in movement, because they serve as a point of 
attachment for muscles. The inner core of bones is composed of hematopoietic tissue (red 
bone marrow, which manufactures blood cells), whereas other parts of bone are storage 
areas for minerals necessary for growth, such as calcium and phosphorus. 

Joints are the places at which bones come together. Several different types of joints are 
found within the body. The type of joint found in any specific location is determined by the 
need for greater or lesser flexibility of movement. 

Muscles, whether attached to bones or to internal organs and blood vessels, are 
responsible for movement. Internal movement involves the contraction and relaxation of 
muscles found in viscera, and external movement is accomplished by the contraction and 
relaxation of muscles that are attached to the bones. Tendons are connective tissue that 
bind muscles to bones, while ligaments bind bones to other bones. 

Orthopedists are physicians who treat (surgically and medically) bone, joint, and muscle 
conditions. Originally, orthopedics was a branch of medicine correcting deformities in 
children (orth/o means straight, ped/o means child). Rheumatologists are physicians 
(nonsurgical) who specialize primarily in joint problems, such as arthritis; in this context, 
rheumat/o, meaning watery flow, refers to joint fluid. Physiatrists are medical doctors 
whose focus is on rehabilitation after injury or illness to muscles, bones, and nerves. 

Both a medical doctor (MD) and an osteopathic physician (DO) can specialize in 
orthopedics or rheumatology. MD and DO medical education programs are similar, and 
both kinds of physicians perform surgery as well as prescribe medication. An osteopath 
has added training in the musculoskeletal system, with an emphasis on body mechanics 
to promote good health. A chiropractor (chir/o means hand) is not a physician but has 
extensive and specialized training in using physical means to manipulate the spinal column, 
joints, and soft tissues. Chiropractic medicine considers that disease is related to pressure 
on nerves by spinal misalignment. 

A physical therapist is a master’s or doctoral degree–prepared health care professional 
who develops a treatment plan based on a physician’s diagnosis. The goals of physical 
therapy (PT) are to restore function, improve mobility, and relieve pain. 

BONES 

FORMATION AND STRUCTURE 

Formation 

Bones are complete organs composed chiefly of connective tissue called osseous (bony) 
tissue, plus a rich supply of blood vessels and nerves. Osseous tissue consists of a combination 
of osteocytes (bone cells), dense connective tissue strands known as collagen, and 
intercellular calcium salts. 



MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 579 


During fetal development, the bones of the fetus are composed of cartilaginous tissue, 
which resembles osseous tissue but is more flexible and less dense because of a lack of 
calcium salts in its intercellular spaces. As the embryo develops, the process of depositing 
calcium salts in the soft, cartilaginous tissue occurs and continues throughout the life 
of the individual after birth. The gradual replacement of cartilage and its intercellular 
substance by immature bone cells and calcium deposits is ossification (bone formation). 

Osteoblasts are the immature osteocytes that produce the bony tissue that replaces 
cartilage during ossification. Osteoclasts (-clast is from the Greek word meaning to break) 
are large cells that function to reabsorb, or digest, bony tissue. Osteoclasts (also called bone 
phagocytes) digest bone tissue from the inner sides of bones thus enlarging the inner bone 
cavity so that the bone does not become overly thick and heavy. When a bone breaks, 
osteoblasts lay down the mineral bone matter (calcium salts) and osteoclasts remove excess 
bone debris (smooth out the bone). 

Osteoblasts and osteoclasts work together in all bones throughout life, tearing down 
(osteoclasts) and rebuilding (osteoblasts) bony tissue. This allows bone to respond to 
mechanical stresses placed on it and thus enables it to be a living tissue, constantly 
rebuilding and renewing itself. 

The formation of bone depends largely on a proper supply of calcium and phosphorus to 
the bone tissue. These minerals must be taken into the body along with a sufficient amount 
of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps calcium to pass through the lining of the small intestine and 
into the bloodstream. Once calcium and phosphorus are in the bones, osteoblastic activity 
produces an enzyme that forms calcium phosphate, a substance that gives bone its 
characteristic hard quality. It is the major calcium salt. 

Not only are calcium and phosphorus part of the hard structure of bone tissue, but 
calcium also is stored elsewhere in bones, and small quantities are present in the blood. If 
the proper amount of calcium is lacking in the blood, nerve fibers are unable to transmit 
impulses effectively to muscles, the heart muscle becomes weak, and muscles attached to 
bones undergo spasms. 

The necessary level of calcium in the blood is maintained by the parathyroid gland, which 
secretes a hormone that signals the release of calcium from bone storage. An excess of the 
hormone (caused by tumor or another pathologic process) will raise blood calcium at the 
expense of the bones, which become weakened by the loss of calcium. 

Structure 

There are 206 bones of various types in the body. Long bones are found in the thigh, lower 
leg, and upper and lower arm. These bones are very strong, are broad at the ends where they 
join with other bones, and have large surface areas for muscle attachment. 

Short bones are found in the wrist and ankle and are small with irregular shapes. Flat 
bones are found covering soft body parts. These bones are the skull, shoulder blades, ribs, 
and pelvic bones. Sesamoid bones are small, rounded bones (resembling a sesame seed in 
shape). They are found near joints, and they increase the efficiency of muscles near a 
particular joint. The kneecap is the largest example of a sesamoid bone.

FIGURE 15-1 A, Divisions of a long bone and interior bone structure. B, Composition of compact 
(cortical) bone. 
Figure 15-1A shows the anatomic divisions of a long bone such as the thigh bone or 
upper arm bone. Label the figure as you read the following. 
The shaft, or middle region, of a long bone is called the diaphysis [1]. Each end of a long 
bone is called an epiphysis [2]. The epiphyseal line or plate [3] represents an area of cartilage 
tissue that is constantly being replaced by new bone tissue as the bone grows; it also 
is commonly known as the growth plate. Cartilage cells at the edges of the epiphyseal 
plate form new bone, which is responsible for lengthening bones during childhood and 
adolescence. The plate calcifies and disappears when the bone has achieved its full growth. 
The metaphysis [4] is the flared portion of the bone; it lies between the epiphysis and the 
diaphysis. It is adjacent to the epiphyseal plate. 
The periosteum [5] is a strong, fibrous, vascular membrane that covers the surface of 
long bones, except at the ends of the epiphyses. It has an extensive nerve supply as well. 
Bones other than long bones are also covered by the periosteum. 
The ends of long bones and the surface of any bone that meets another bone to form a 
joint are covered with articular cartilage [6]. When two bones come together to form a 
joint, the bones themselves do not touch precisely. The articular cartilage that caps the end 
of one bone comes into contact with that of the other bone. Articular cartilage is a very 
smooth, strong, and slick tissue. It cushions the joint and allows it to move smoothly and 
efficiently. Unlike the cartilage of the epiphyseal plate, which disappears when a bone 
achieves its full growth, articular cartilage is present throughout life.


MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 581 


Compact (cortical) bone [7] is a layer of hard, dense bone that lies under the periosteum 
in all bones and is located chiefly around the diaphysis of long bones. Within the compact 
bone is a system of small canals containing blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients 
to the bone and remove waste products such as carbon dioxide. Figure 15-1B shows these 
channels, called haversian canals [8], in the compact bone. Compact bone is tunneled out 
in the central shaft of the long bones by a medullary cavity [9] that contains yellow bone 
marrow. Yellow marrow is composed chiefly of fat cells. 

Cancellous bone [10], sometimes called spongy or trabecular bone, is much more porous 
and less dense than compact bone. The mineral matter in it is laid down in a series of 
separated bony fibers that make up a spongy latticework. These interwoven fibers, called 
trabeculae, are found largely in the epiphyses and metaphyses of long bones and in the 
middle portion of most other bones of the body as well. Spaces in cancellous bone contain 
red bone marrow. The red marrow consists of immature and mature blood cells in various 
stages of development. Hematopoiesis is formation of all types of blood cells in the bone 
marrow. 

In an adult, the ribs, pelvic bone, sternum (breastbone), and vertebrae, as well as the 
epiphyses of long bones, contain red bone marrow within cancellous tissue. Red marrow in 
the medullary cavity of long bones is plentiful in young children but decreases through the 
years and is replaced by yellow marrow. 

PROCESSES AND DEPRESSIONS IN BONES 

Bone processes are enlarged areas that extend out from bones to serve as attachments for 
muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Bone depressions are openings or hollow regions serving 
as connections between bones, or passageways for blood vessels and nerves. Table 15-1 lists 
various processes and depressions for your reference.

CRANIAL BONES 
The bones of the skull, or cranium, protect the brain and structures related to it, such as 
the sense organs. Muscles for controlling head movements and chewing motions are 
connected to the cranial bones. The cranial bones join each other at joints called sutures. 
The cranial bones of a newborn child are not completely joined. There are gaps of 
unossified tissue in the skull at birth. These are called soft spots, or fontanelles (“little 
fountains”). The pulse of blood vessels can be felt (palpated) under the skin in those areas. 
Figure 15-3 illustrates the bones of the cranium. Label them as you read the following 
descriptions: 
FIGURE 15-3 Cranial bones, lateral view. The mental (ment/o = chin) foramen is the opening in the

Frontal bone [1]—forms the forehead and the roof of the bony sockets that contain the 
eyes. 
Parietal bone [2]—the two bones (one on each side of the skull) that form the roof and 
upper part of the sides of the cranium. 

Temporal bone [3]—the two bones that form the lower sides and base of the cranium. 
Each bone encloses an ear and contains a fossa for joining with the mandible (lower 
jawbone). The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the area of connection between the 
temporal and mandibular bones. The mastoid process is a round (mast/o means 
breast) process of the temporal bone behind the ear. The styloid process (styl/o means 
pole or stake) projects downward from the temporal bone. 

Occipital bone [4]—forms the back and base of the skull and joins the parietal and 
temporal bones, forming a suture. The inferior portion of the occipital bone has an 
opening called the foramen magnum through which the spinal cord passes (see 
Figure 15-4). 

Sphenoid bone [5]—the bat-shaped bone that extends behind the eyes and forms part of 
the base of the skull. Because it joins with the frontal, occipital, and ethmoid bones, it 
serves as an anchor to hold those skull bones together (sphen/o means wedge). The 
sella turcica (meaning Turkish saddle) is a depression in the sphenoid bone in which 
the pituitary gland is located (see Figure 15-4). 

Ethmoid bone [6]—the thin, delicate bone that supports the nasal cavity and forms part 
of the sockets of the eyes. It is composed primarily of spongy, cancellous bone, which 
contains numerous small holes (ethm/o means sieve). 

Study Figure 15-4, which shows these cranial bones as viewed from above downward, 
toward the floor of the cranial cavity.

FACIAL BONES 
All of the facial bones except one are joined together by sutures, so they are immovable. The 
mandible (lower jawbone) is the only facial bone capable of movement. This ability is 
necessary for activities such as mastication (chewing) and speaking. 
Figure 15-5 shows the facial bones; label it as you read the following descriptions of the 
facial bones: 
Nasal bones [1]—the two slender bones that support the bridge of the nose (nas/o means 
nose). They join with the frontal bone superiorly and form part of the nasal septum. 
Lacrimal bones [2]—the two small, thin bones located at the corner of each eye. The 
lacrimal (lacrim/o means tear) bones contain fossae for the lacrimal gland (tear gland) 
and canals for the passage of the lacrimal duct. 
Maxillary bones [3]—the two large bones that compose the massive upper jawbones 
(maxillae). They are joined by a suture in the median plane. If the two bones do not 
come together normally before birth, the condition known as cleft palate results. 
Mandibular bone [4]—the lower jawbone (mandible). Both the maxilla and the mandible 
contain the sockets called alveoli in which the teeth are embedded. The mandible joins 
the skull at the region of the temporal bone, forming the temporomandibular joint 
(TMJ) on either side of the skull. 
Zygomatic bones [5]—the two bones, one on each side of the face, that form the high 
portion of the cheek. 
Vomer [6]—the thin, single, flat bone that forms the lower portion of the nasal septum. 
Sinuses, or air cavities, are located in specific places within the cranial and facial bones 
to lighten the skull and warm and moisten air as it passes through. Figure 15-6 shows 
the sinuses of the skull. 
Table 15-2 reviews the cranial and facial bones with the location of each bone.

VERTEBRAL COLUMN AND STRUCTURE OF VERTEBRAE 

The vertebral (spinal) column is composed of 26 bone segments, called vertebrae, that are 
arranged in five divisions from the base of the skull to the tailbone. The bones are separated 
by pads of cartilage called intervertebral disks (discs). 

Figure 15-7A illustrates the general structure of a vertebra. Although the individual 
vertebrae in the separate regions of the spinal column are all slightly different in structure, 
they do have several parts in common. 

A vertebra is composed of an inner, thick, round anterior portion called the vertebral 
body [1]. Between the body of one vertebra and the body of the vertebra lying beneath or 
above is an intervertebral disk (disc). This is a pad of cartilage that provides flexibility and 
absorbs shocks to the vertebral column (see Figure 15-7B). A spinal disk herniation occurs 
when a tear in a disk causes a portion of the disk to bulge out into the neural canal. 

The posterior portion of a vertebra (vertebral arch) consists of a single spinous process 
[2], a transverse process [3] on each side of the spinous process, and a bar-like lamina [4] 
between each transverse process and the spinous process. The neural canal [5] is the space 
between the vertebral body and the vertebral arch through which the spinal cord passes. 
Figure 15-7B shows a lateral view of several vertebrae. Note the location of the spinal cord 
running through the neural canal.

lead to narrowing of the neural canal and spinal stenosis.

curvatures are present at birth. The cervical curvature develops when the infant holds the head erect. The 
lumbar curvature develops as the infant begins to stand and walk. 
Figure 15-8 illustrates the divisions of the vertebral column: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, 
sacrum, and coccyx. 
The first seven bones of the vertebral column, forming the bony aspect of the neck, are 
the cervical (C1 to C7) vertebrae. These vertebrae do not articulate (join) with the ribs. 
The second set of 12 vertebrae is known as the thoracic (T1 to T12) vertebrae. These 
vertebrae articulate with the 12 pairs of ribs. 
The third set of five vertebral bones is the lumbar (L1 to L5) vertebrae. They are the 
strongest and largest of the backbones. Like the cervical vertebrae, these bones do not 
articulate with the ribs. 
The sacral vertebrae (sacrum) are five separate bones that fuse in a young child. In an 
adult, the sacrum is a slightly curved, triangularly shaped bone. 
The coccyx is the tailbone, and it, too, is a fused bone, having been formed from four 
small coccygeal bones.

MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 589 


Scapula [2] (plural: scapulae)—shoulder blade; one of two flat, triangular bones on each 
dorsal side of the thorax. The extension of the scapula that joins with the clavicle to 
form a joint above the shoulder is called the acromion (acr/o means extremity, om/o 
means shoulder). The joint formed by these two bones is known as the acromioclavicular 
(AC) joint. Figure 15-10A shows a posterior view of the scapula. 

Sternum [3]—breastbone; a flat bone extending ventrally down the midline of the chest. 
The upper part of the sternum articulates on the sides with the clavicle and ribs, 
and the lower, narrower portion is attached to the ribs, diaphragm, and abdominal 
muscles. The lowest portion of the sternum is the xiphoid process (xiph/o means 
sword). The uppermost portion is the manubrium (from a Latin term meaning handle). 

Ribs [4]—There are 12 pairs of ribs. The first 7 pairs join the sternum anteriorly through 
cartilaginous attachments called costal cartilages. Ribs 1 to 7 are called true ribs. 
They join with the sternum anteriorly and with the vertebral column posteriorly. Ribs 
8 to 10 are called false ribs. They join with the vertebral column posteriorly but join 
the 7th rib anteriorly instead of attaching to the sternum. Ribs 11 and 12 are the 
floating ribs because they are completely free at their anterior ends. Figure 15-10A 
shows a posterior view of the rib cage. 

Bones of the Arm and Hand 

These are described with the subject in the anatomic position—standing, with the arms 
held at the sides and the palms forward. 

Humerus [5]—upper arm bone; the large head of the humerus is rounded and joins with 
the glenoid fossa of the scapula to form the shoulder or glenoid humeral joint (see 
Figure 15-10A). A cuff of cartilage, called a labrum, allows the humerus to move in 
the glenoid fossa (see Figure 15-10B). 

Ulna [6]—medial lower arm (forearm) bone; the proximal bony process of the ulna at the 
elbow is called the olecranon (elbow bone). The olecranon is the bony point of the 
elbow when the elbow is bent. 

Radius [7]—lateral lower arm (forearm) bone (in line with the thumb). 

Carpals [8]—wrist bones; there are two rows of four bones in the wrist.

Metacarpals [9]—the five bones of the palm of the hand. 

Phalanges [10] (singular: phalanx)—finger bones. Each finger (except the thumb) has 
three phalanges: a proximal, a middle, and a distal phalanx. The thumb has only two 
phalanges: a proximal and a distal phalanx. 

Bones of the Pelvis 

Pelvic girdle [11]—pelvis. This collection of bones supports the trunk of the body and 
articulates with the femur to form the hip joint. The adult pelvis is composed of three 
pairs of fused bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. 

Ilium—uppermost and largest portion of the pelvis. Dorsally, the two parts of the ilium 
do not meet. Rather, they join the sacrum on either side to form the sacroiliac joints. 
The connection between the iliac bones and the sacrum is very firm, and very little 
motion occurs at these joints. The superior part of the ilium is the iliac crest. It is 
filled with red bone marrow and serves as an attachment for abdominal wall muscles. 

Ischium—inferior or lower part of the pelvis. The ischium and the tendons and muscles 
attached to it are what you sit on. 

Pubis—anterior part of the pelvis. The two pubic bones join by way of a cartilaginous 
disk. This area is called the pubic symphysis. Like the sacroiliac joints, this area is 
quite rigid. 

Pelvic cavity—region within the ring of bone formed by the pelvic girdle. The rectum, 
sigmoid colon, bladder, and female reproductive organs lie within the pelvic cavity and 
are protected by the rigid architecture of the pelvic girdle. See Chapter 2, page 55, for 
comparison of the male pelvis and the female pelvis. 

Bones of the Leg and Foot 

Femur [12]—thigh bone; this is the longest bone in the body. At its proximal end it has 
a rounded head that fits into a depression, or socket, in the pelvis. This socket is called 
the acetabulum. The acetabulum was named because of its resemblance to a rounded 
cup the Romans used for vinegar (acetum). The head of the femur and the acetabulum 
form a ball-and-socket joint otherwise known as the hip joint. See inset in Figure 15-9. 

Patella [13]—kneecap; this is a small, flat bone that lies in front of the articulation 
between the femur and one of the lower leg bones called the tibia. It is a sesamoid bone 
surrounded by protective tendons and held in place by muscle attachments. Together 
with the femur and the tibia, it forms the knee joint. 

Tibia [14]—larger of the two bones of the lower leg; the tibia runs under the skin in the 
front part of the leg. It joins with the femur and patella proximally, and at its distal end 
(ankle) forms a flare that is the bony prominence (medial malleolus) at the inside of 
the ankle. The tibia commonly is called the shin bone. 

Fibula [15]—smaller of the two lower leg bones; this thin bone, well hidden under the 
leg muscles, runs parallel to the tibia. At its distal part, it forms a flare, which is the 
bony prominence (lateral malleolus) on the outside of the ankle. The tibia, fibula, and 
talus (the first of the tarsal bones) come together to form the ankle joint. 

Tarsals [16]—bones of the hind part of the foot (hindfoot); these seven short bones 
resemble the carpal bones of the wrist but are larger. The calcaneus is the largest of 
these bones and also is called the heel bone (Figure 15-11). As noted, the talus is one 
of three bones that form the ankle joint.

PATHOLOGY—BONES 


Ewing sarcoma 
Rare malignant tumor arising in bone; most often occurring in 
children. 

Pain and swelling are common, especially if the tumor involves the shaft 
(medullary cavity) of a long bone. This tumor usually occurs at an early age 
between 5 and 15 years, and combined treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and 
chemotherapy represents the best chance for cure (60% to 70% of patients are 
cured if metastasis has not occurred). 

exostosis Bony growth (benign) arising from the surface of bone. 
Osteochondromas (composed of cartilage and bone) are benign exostoses usually 
found on the metaphyses of long bones near the epiphyseal plates. Ex- means out; 
-ostosis is condition of bones. 
A bunion is a swelling of the metatarsophalangeal joint near the base of the big 
toe and is accompanied by the buildup of soft tissue and underlying bone at the 
distal/medial aspect of the first metatarsal. 

 
Peroneal/Peritoneal/Perineal 

Peroneal means pertaining to the fibula (smaller of two lower leg bones). Don’t confuse this term with peritoneal, meaning 
pertaining to the peritoneum (membrane surrounding the abdominal organs), and perineal, meaning pertaining to the area 
between the rectum and the vagina in females, and between the rectum and scrotal sac in males.

Compression fracture 

(vertebra) 


15 
fracture Traumatic breaking of a bone. 
In a simple (closed) fracture, the bone is broken but there is no open wound in 
the skin. In a compound (open) fracture, the bone is broken and a fragment of 
bone protrudes through an open wound in the skin. See Figure 15-14A. Crepitus 
is the crackling sound produced when ends of bones rub each other or rub 
against roughened cartilage. Table 15-4 lists different types of fractures and their 
descriptions. Figure 15-14B illustrates these fractures. 
Treatment of fractures involves reduction, which is restoration of the bone to 
its normal position. A closed reduction is manipulative reduction without a 
surgical incision; in an open reduction, an incision is made for access to the 
fracture site. A cast (solid mold of the body part) is applied to fractures to 
immobilize the injured bone after a closed reduction. The abbreviation ORIF 
means open reduction/internal fixation. Often this involves insertion of metal 
plates, screws, rods, or pins to stabilize the bone.

600 MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 


osteogenic sarcoma Common malignant tumor arising from osteoblasts, found primarily in 
(osteosarcoma) children and adolescents. 
Osteoblasts multiply, forming large, bony tumors, especially at the ends of long 
bones (half of the lesions are located just below or just above the knee) (Figure 
15-15). Metastasis (spread of tumor) takes place through the bloodstream, often 
affecting the lungs. Surgical resection followed by chemotherapy improves the 
survival rate. 
Malignant tumors from other parts of the body (breast, prostate, lung, thyroid 
gland, and kidney) that metastasize to bones are metastatic bone lesions. 
osteomalacia Softening of bone, with inadequate amounts of mineral (calcium) in 
the bone. 
Osteomalacia occurs primarily as a disease of infancy and childhood and is then 
known as rickets. Bones fail to receive adequate amounts of calcium and 
phosphorus; they become soft, bend easily, and become deformed. 
In affected patients, vitamin D is deficient in the diet, which prevents calcium 
and phosphorus from being absorbed into the bloodstream from the intestines. 
Vitamin D is formed by the action of sunlight on certain compounds (such as 
cholesterol) in the skin; thus, rickets is more common in large, smoky cities 
during the winter months. 
Treatment most often consists of administration of large daily doses of vitamin 
D and an increase in dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus. 
osteomyelitis Inflammation of the bone and bone marrow secondary to infection. 
Bacteria enter the body through a wound and spread to the bone. Children are 
affected most often, and the infection usually occurs near the ends of long bones 
of the legs and arms. Adults can be affected too, usually as the result of an open 
fracture. 
The lesion begins as an inflammation with pus collection. Pus tends to spread 
down the medullary cavity and outward to the periosteum. Antibiotic therapy 
corrects the condition if the infection is treated quickly. If treatment is delayed, an 
abscess can form. An abscess is a walled-off area of infection that can be difficult 
or impossible to penetrate with antibiotics. Surgical drainage of an abscess usually 
is necessary. 
osteoporosis Decrease in bone density (mass); thinning and weakening of bone. 
Osteopenia is a condition in which bone mineral density is lower than normal. In 
some cases, it is a precursor to osteoporosis. In osteoporosis, the interior of bones 
is diminished in structure, as if the steel skeleton of a building had rusted and 
deteriorated (Figure 15-16). The condition commonly occurs in older women as a 
consequence of estrogen deficiency with menopause. Lack of estrogen promotes

excessive bone resorption (osteoclast activity) and less bone deposition. Weakened 
bones are subject to fracture (as in the hip); loss of height and kyphosis occur as 
vertebrae collapse (Figure 15-17). 

Osteoporosis can occur with atrophy caused by disuse, as in a limb that is in a 
cast, in the legs of a person with paraplegia, or in a bedridden patient. It also may 
occur in men as part of the aging process and in patients who have received 
corticosteroids (hormones made by the adrenal gland and used to treat 
inflammatory conditions). 

Treatment and prevention of osteoporosis 


are critical to maintaining 
strong bones and avoiding fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist. 
FIGURE 15-17 Kyphosis. Loss of bone 
mass due to osteoporosis produces posterior 
curvature of the spine in the thoracic region. 
A normal spine is shown at the age of 40 
years, and osteoporotic changes are 
illustrated at the ages of 60 and 70 years. The 
changes in the spine can cause a loss of as 
much as 6 to 9 inches in height. 

 
Preventing Osteoporosis 

15 
Age40 60 70 


Prevention of osteoporosis includes the following: 

. Balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D 
. Weight-bearing and resistance exercise 
. Reduction of smoking and alcohol intake 
. Checking bone mineral density (BMD) with a DEXA test (see page 619) 
. Medications when appropriate—such as bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Boniva) and selective estrogen receptor modulators 
(SERMs—Raloxifene, Evista) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 


602 MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 

talipes Congenital abnormality of the hindfoot (involving the talus). 

Talipes (Latin talus = ankle, pes = foot) is a congenital anomaly. The most 
common form is talipes equinovarus (equin/o = horse), or clubfoot. The infant 
cannot stand with the sole of the foot flat on the ground. The defect can be 
corrected by applying orthopedic casts in the early months of infancy or, if that 
fails, by surgery. 

JOINTS 

TYPES OF JOINTS 

A joint (articulation) is a coming together of two or more bones. Some joints are immovable, 
such as the suture joints between the skull bones. Other joints, such as those between the 
vertebrae, are partially movable. Most joints, however, allow considerable movement. These 
freely movable joints are called synovial joints. Examples of synovial joints are the ball-andsocket 
type (the hip and shoulder joints) and the hinge type (elbow, knee, and ankle joints). 
Label the structures in Figure 15-18 as you read the following description of a synovial 
joint. 

The bones in a synovial joint are surrounded by a joint capsule [1] composed of fibrous 
tissue. Ligaments (thickened fibrous bands of connective tissue) anchor one bone to 
another and thereby add considerable strength to the joint capsule in critical areas. Bones 
at the joint are covered with a smooth, glistening white tissue called the articular cartilage 
[2]. The synovial membrane [3] lies under the joint capsule and lines the synovial cavity [4] 
between the bones. The synovial cavity is filled with a special lubricating fluid produced by 
the synovial membrane. This synovial fluid contains water and nutrients that nourish as 
well as lubricate the joints so that friction on the articular cartilage is minimal. 

A meniscus is a crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure that partly divides a joint 
cavity and acts as a protective cushion. It is present in the knee (see Figure 15-19). 

BURSAE 

Bursae (singular: bursa) are closed sacs of synovial fluid lined with a synovial membrane 
and are located near but not within a joint. Bursae are present wherever two types of tissue 
need to slide past one another with as little friction as possible. Bursae serve as layers of 
lubrication between the tissues. Common sites of bursae are between tendons (connective 
tissue that connects a muscle to bone) and bones, between ligaments (connective tissue 
binding bone to bone) and bones, and between skin and bones in areas where bony anatomy 
is prominent.

Some common locations of bursae are at the elbow joint (olecranon bursa), knee joint 
(prepatellar bursa), and shoulder joint (subacromial bursa). Figure 15-19A shows a lateral

Notice the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which may be damaged (“torn ligament”) with knee injury. Reconstruction of the ACL 
can require extensive surgery, and months of physical therapy may be required before return of normal function. See case study,

VOCABULARY—JOINTS 
This list reviews many new terms related to joints introduced in the text. Short definitions reinforce your 
understanding of the terms. Refer to the Pronunciation of Terms on page 645 for help with unfamiliar or 
difficult terms. 
articular cartilage Smooth, glistening white tissue that covers the surface of a joint. 
articulation Any type of joint. 
bursa ( plural: bursae) Sac of fluid near a joint; promotes smooth sliding of one tissue against 
another. 
ligament Connective tissue binding bones to other bones; supports, strengthens, 
and stabilizes the joint. 
meniscus Crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure found in the knee. 
suture joint Immovable joint, such as between the bones of the skull. 
synovial cavity Space between bones at a synovial joint; contains synovial fluid 
produced by the synovial membrane. 
synovial fluid Viscous (sticky) fluid within the synovial cavity. Synovial fluid is similar 
in viscosity to egg white; this accounts for the origin of the term 
(syn- = like, ov/o = egg). 
synovial joint A freely movable joint. 
synovial membrane Tissue lining the synovial cavity; it produces synovial fluid. 
tendon Connective tissue that binds muscles to bones.

Inflammation of articular cartilage is arthritis, whereas a “torn 
cartilage” is specifically a tear of a meniscus. 

bursitis ___________________________________________ 

Causes of this periarticular condition may be related to stress 
placed on the bursa or to diseases such as gout or rheumatoid 
arthritis. The bursa becomes inflamed and movement is limited 
and painful. Intrabursal injection of corticosteroids and also rest 
and splinting of the limb are helpful in treatment. 

achondroplasia _____________________________________ 

This is an inherited condition in which the bones of the arms and 
legs fail to grow to normal size because of a defect in cartilage 
and bone formation. Dwarfism results, characterized by short 
limbs and a normal-sized head and trunk. See page 80. 

chondroma ________________________________________ 

chondromalacia ____________________________________ 

Chondromalacia patellae is a softening and roughening of the 
articular cartilaginous surface of the kneecap, resulting in pain, a 
grating sensation, and mechanical “catching” behind the patella 
with joint movement.

PATHOLOGY—JOINTS 

arthritis Inflammation of any joint. 
Some of the more common forms are: 
1. ankylosing spondylitis Chronic, progressive arthritis with stiffening of joints, primarily of the 
spine. 
Bilateral sclerosis (hardening) of the sacroiliac joints is a diagnostic sign. Joint 
changes are similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis, and the condition can 
respond to corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs. 
2. gouty arthritis (gout) Inflammation and painful swelling of joints caused by excessive uric 
acid in the body. 
A congenital defect in the metabolism of uric acid causes too much of it to 
accumulate in blood (hyperuricemia), joints, and soft tissues near joints. The 
“pointy” uric acid crystals (salts) destroy the articular cartilage and damage the 
synovial membrane, often resulting in excruciating pain. The joint chiefly affected 
is the big toe; hence, the condition often is called podagra (pod/o = foot, -agra = 
excessive pain). Treatment consists of drugs to lower uric acid production 
(allopurinol) and to prevent inflammation (colchicine and indomethacin) and a 
special diet that avoids foods that are rich in uric acid, such as red meats, red 
wines, and fermented cheeses. 
3. osteoarthritis (OA) Progressive, degenerative joint disease with loss of articular cartilage 
and hypertrophy of bone (formation of osteophytes, or bone spurs) at 
articular surfaces. 
This condition, also known as degenerative joint disease, can occur in any joint, 
but occurs mainly in the spine, hips, and knees of older people. It is marked by a 
narrowing of the joint space (due to loss of cartilage). Treatment consists of 
aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation 
and pain and physical therapy to loosen impaired joints. Figure 15-21 compares a 
normal joint and those with changes characteristic of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
End-stage osteoarthritis is the most common reason for joint replacement 
surgery (total joint arthroplasty). 
4. rheumatoid arthritis Chronic joint condition with inflammation and pain; caused by an 
(RA) autoimmune reaction against joint tissue, particularly the synovial 
membrane. 
The small joints of the hands and feet are affected first, and larger joints later. 
Women are more commonly afflicted than men. Synovial membranes become 
inflamed and thickened, damaging the articular cartilage and preventing easy 
movement (see Figure 15-21). Sometimes fibrous tissue forms and calcifies, 
creating a bony ankylosis (pathologic union) at the joint and preventing any 
movement at all. Swollen, painful joints accompanied by pyrexia (fever) are 
symptoms. 
Diagnosis is by a blood test that shows the presence of the rheumatoid factor 
(an antibody) and x-ray images revealing changes around the affected joints. 
Treatment consists of heat applications and drugs such as aspirin and other 
NSAIDs and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and pain. Disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and gold salts also are used.

Enlargement of bone or tissue around the joint at the base of the big

Chronic irritation from ill-fitting shoes can cause a buildup of soft tissue and 
underlying bone. Bunionectomy (removal of a bony exostosis and associated soft 
tissue) is indicated if other measures (changing shoes and use of anti-inflammatory 
agents) fail. See Figure 15-22. Another name for a bunion is hallux (great toe) 
valgus (abnormal angulation of the toe).

carpal tunnel syndrome Compression of the median nerve as it passes between the ligament and 
(CTS) the bones and tendons of the wrist. 

CTS is caused by compression of the median nerve (see Figure 15-23) in the carpal 
tunnel. The compression results from swelling and/or inflammation of the flexor 
tendons. The thumb, the index and long (middle) fingers, and the radial half of the 
ring finger become dysesthetic (numb). 

Treatment consists of splinting the wrist during sleep to immobilize it, use of 
anti-inflammatory medications, and injection of cortisone into the carpal tunnel. 
If these measures fail, surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament is usually 
curative. 

dislocation 
Displacement of a bone from its joint. 

Dislocated bones do not articulate with each other. The most common cause of 
dislocations is trauma. Shoulder dislocation (disruption of articulation between 
the head of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the scapula) and hip dislocation 
(disruption of articulation between the head of the femur and the acetabulum of 
the pelvis) are examples. 

Treatment of dislocations involves reduction, which is restoration of the bones 
to their normal positions. A subluxation is a partial or incomplete dislocation. 

ganglion cyst 
Fluid-filled sac arising from joint capsules or tendons, typically in 
the hand. 

Most common in the wrist, but can occur in the shoulder, knee, hip, or ankle. See 
Figure 15-24. Treatment ranges from immobilization and reduced activity to 
aspiration of fluid if necessary.

treatment in the past was to strike the ganglion with a Bible to rupture it. 

herniation of an 
intervertebral disk (disc) 

Abnormal protrusion of an intervertebral disk into the spinal canal or 

spinal nerves. 
This condition is commonly referred to as a “slipped disk.” Pain is experienced as 
the inner portion of the disk (nucleus pulposus) presses on spinal nerves or on the 
spinal cord. See Figure 15-25A. Low back pain and sciatica (pain radiating down 
the leg) are symptoms when the disk protrudes in the lumbar spine. See Figure 
15-25B. Neck pain and burning pain radiating down an arm are characteristic of 
a herniated disk in the cervical spine. Physical therapy, drugs for pain, and 
epidural cortisone injections may help initially. In patients with chronic or 
recurrent disk herniation, microdiskectomy (removal of a portion of the protruding 
disk) may be advised. See Figure 15-26A. In microendoscopic surgery, the disk is 
removed by inserting a tube through the skin and aspirating the disk through 
the tube.

It was first reported in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and is now found throughout the 
eastern coastal region of the United States. It is often marked by a “bull’s eye” rash 
at the site of the tick bite. See Figure 15-26B. The condition is treated with 
antibiotics. In some cases, Lyme disease can affect the nervous system. See In 
Person account on page 622. 
sprain Trauma to ligaments without rupture. 
A strain is an injury involving the overstretching of muscle. Application of 
gentle compressive wraps is an immediate measure to relieve pain and minimize 
swelling caused by sprains and strains. Application of ice and elevation of the 
extremity are also helpful. 
systemic lupus Chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving joints, skin, 
erythematosus (SLE) kidneys, central nervous system (CNS), heart, and lungs. 
This condition affects connective tissue (specifically a protein component called 
collagen) in tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage all over the body. Typically, 
there is a red, scaly rash over the nose and cheeks (“butterfly” rash) (Figure 
15-27). Patients, usually women, experience joint pain in several joints 
(polyarthralgia), pyrexia (fever), kidney inflammation, and malaise. SLE is an 
autoimmune disease that is diagnosed by the presence of abnormal antibodies in 
the blood and characteristic white blood cells called LE cells. Treatment involves 
giving corticosteroids, hormones made by the adrenal gland that are used to treat 
inflammatory conditions. 
The name lupus, meaning wolf, has been used since the 13th century, because 
people with lupus looked like their skin had been affected by wolf bites.

MUSCLES 

TYPES OF MUSCLES 

There are three types of muscles in the body. Label Figure 15-28 as you read the following 
descriptions of the various types of muscles. 

Striated muscle [1] makes up the voluntary or skeletal muscles that move all bones, as 
well as controlling facial expression and eye movements. Through the central and peripheral 
nervous systems, we have conscious control over these muscles. Striated muscle fibers 
(cells) have a pattern of dark and light bands, or fibrils, in their cytoplasm. Fibrous tissue 
that envelops and separates muscles is called fascia, which contains the muscle’s blood, 
lymph, and nerve supply.

posterior and anterior aspect of the leg and their functions. The Evolve site contains additional anterior and posterior images 
of major muscles and their functions. 

Smooth muscle [2] makes up the involuntary or visceral muscles that move internal 
organs such as the digestive tract, blood vessels, and secretory ducts leading from glands. 
These muscles are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. They are called smooth 
because they have no dark and light fibrils in their cytoplasm. Skeletal muscle fibers are 
arranged in bundles, whereas smooth muscle forms sheets of fibers as it wraps around 
tubes and vessels. 

Cardiac muscle [3] is striated in appearance but is like smooth muscle in its action. Its 

movement cannot be consciously controlled. The fibers of cardiac muscle are branching 

fibers and are found in the heart. 

ACTIONS OF SKELETAL MUSCLES 

Skeletal (striated) muscles (more than 600 in the human body) are the muscles that move 
bones. Figure 15-29 shows some skeletal muscles of the head, neck, and torso and muscles 
of the posterior aspect of the leg. When a muscle contracts, one of the bones to which it is 
joined remains virtually stationary as a result of other muscles that hold it in place. The 
point of attachment of the muscle to the stationary bone is called the origin (beginning) of 
that muscle. When the muscle contracts, however, another bone to which it is attached 
does move. The point of junction of the muscle to the bone that moves is called the insertion 
of the muscle. Most often, the origin of a muscle lies proximal in the skeleton, whereas its 
insertion lies distal. 

Figure 15-30 shows the biceps and triceps muscles in the upper arm. One origin of the 

biceps is at the scapula, and its insertion is at the radius. Tendons are the connective tissue 

bands that connect muscles to the bones.

PATHOLOGY—MUSCLES 

muscular dystrophy 
Group of inherited diseases characterized by progressive weakness and 
degeneration of muscle fibers without involvement of the nervous 
system. 

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common form. Muscles appear to 
enlarge (pseudohypertrophy) as fat replaces functional muscle cells that have 
degenerated and atrophied. Onset of muscle weakness occurs soon after birth, 
and diagnosis can be made by muscle biopsy and electromyography. The disease 
predominantly affects males; muscle weakness produces stumbling, falling, 
lordosis, winged (prominent) scapulae, and cardiac problems. 

polymyositis 
Chronic inflammatory myopathy. 

This condition is marked by symmetrical muscle weakness and pain, often 
accompanied by a rash around the eyes and on the face and limbs. Evidence that 
polymyositis is an autoimmune disorder is growing stronger, and some patients 
recover completely with immunosuppressive therapy. 

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

15 
LABORATORY TESTS 
antinuclear antibody test 
(ANA) 
Detects an antibody present in serum of patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. 
erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR) 
Measures time it takes for erythrocytes to settle to the bottom of a test 
tube. 
Elevated ESR is associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, tumors, and infections, and with chronic infections of bone and soft 
tissue. 
rheumatoid factor test (RF) Serum is tested for the presence of an antibody found in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis. 
serum calcium (Ca) Measurement of calcium level in serum. 
Hypercalcemia may be caused by disorders of the parathyroid gland and malignancy 
that affects bone metabolism. Hypocalcemia is seen in critically ill patients with 
burns, sepsis, and acute renal failure. 
serum creatine kinase (CK) Measurement of the enzyme creatine kinase in serum. 
This enzyme normally is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Increased levels 
occur in muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, and with traumatic injuries. 



618 MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM 


uric acid test Measurement of uric acid in serum. 
High levels are associated with gouty arthritis. 
CLINICAL PROCEDURES 
arthrocentesis Surgical puncture to remove fluid from the joint space. 
Synovial fluid is removed for analysis. 
arthrography Taking x-ray images after injection of contrast material into a joint. 
arthroplasty Surgical repair or replacement of a joint. 
Total hip arthroplasty or total hip replacement (THR) is replacement of the 
femoral head and acetabulum with prostheses that are fastened into the bone 
(Figure 15-33). 
In a total knee replacement (TKR) a metal prosthesis covers the end of the 
femur, and a tibial component made of metal and plastic covers the tip end of the 
tibia. See page 625 for a clinical case showing TKR and page 626 for an In Person 
account of the procedure. 
Other examples of arthroplasties are resection arthroplasty (small portion of a 
bone is removed to repair the joint; acromioclavicular joint is a common location), 
interposition arthroplasty (new tissue taken from another place is placed between 
damaged surface of elbow joint), and revision arthroplasty (an operation to 
replace a failing prosthetic joint).

IN PERSON 
This first-person account was written by a woman diagnosed with 
neurological Lyme disease. 

Weeding the garden and pruning the shrubs are chores I have willingly 
performed many, many times with no ill effects except an occasional 
backache, some scratches, and the misery of poison ivy. To avoid bending 
over I would often kneel or sit down in the garden. ln late June 2009 
I not only got quite dirty, but unknowingly connected with a deer 
tick and developed acute neurological Lyme disease. One day shortly 
after working in the garden, I developed a fever and noticed a rash all 
over my trunk. I figured I had a summer virus that would go away in a 
few days. I never suspected Lyme disease. There was no tick and no 
telltale “bulls-eye” pattern in the rash. Indeed, I did feel fine in just a few 
days—the respite lasted just one day, however. The next day, I had 
another rash and was feeling poorly. My husband Paul drove me to the 
doctor’s office where a physician’s assistant took some blood and gave 
me a prescription for doxycycline. I had taken just four doses when my 
condition worsened alarmingly. I lost my balance and could barely lift 
my head up while lying in bed. Mental processing was slow and I was having difficulty with word finding— 
more than the usual memory lapses of a healthy 67-year-old. When I called the doctor’s office, I was told to 
stop taking the doxycycline as I could be having an allergic reaction. We went back to the doctor’s office, where 
I was put into an ambulance and sent to the hospital. 

Neurologists and infectious disease specialists examined me over the next five days and ordered tests, e.g., 
an MRI (to rule out stroke), EMGs (there was delayed nerve conduction in my legs), and a lumbar puncture 
(spinal tap). The doctors first suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome, a scary paralyzing autoimmune disease, but 
the blood work indicated that my condition was Lyme disease. I learned that in Lyme disease, the bite of an 
infected deer tick releases a spirochete (bacterium) into the bloodstream and can affect joints, the nervous 
system, and other organs. 

My treatment was a course of intravenous antibiotics. A PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was 
implanted in my upper arm leading to the superior vena cava to gain access to my bloodstream. I was given a 
prescription for a powerful antibiotic called ceftriaxone (though I was not allergic to the first antibiotic, 
doxycycline, after all) and I was allowed to go home. I reclined in a hospital bed in the dining room and 
received excellent nursing care from my husband, a college professor, who, luckily, could be at home with me 
24/7. Paul carefully infused 2000 mg of ceftriaxone daily and kept the PICC sterile. He also held on to me in 
the bathtub where I sat on a bathtub chair and helped me wash my hair. Now that was an experience! 

Physical therapists, occupational therapists. and visiting nurses came to the house over the next three 
weeks. I had to practice writing my name and the numbers 1 to 10. I had to coordinate getting out of bed and 
standing up–without holding on to the bed. I learned to walk and balance on one foot by holding on to the 
kitchen counter. I went up stairs slowly holding on to the banister for dear life and went down stairs on my 
bottom like a crab. Eventually, I had a walker, then a cane, and Paul escorted me on short trips around the top 
of the driveway. During this time, I also made follow-up visits to doctors. I had strength in my legs and feet 
but was still wobbly mentally and physically. One day I was able to walk by myself in the neighborhood–this a 
triumph for a woman who was used to a 3. mile daily walk and long bike rides. I also exercised in the shallow 
end of our swimming pool. But I could not drive until the neurological symptoms resolved. This was the only 
thing Paul and I fought about! The first time he took me for a “driving test,” he flunked me. I was indignant, 
to say the least. In another few weeks my timing and coordination had improved and I was able to drive and 
begin to take long walks and bike rides once again. I also joined a health club to vary my exercise routine and 
have kept at it ever since. I no longer get down and dirty when I pull weeds in the garden.

MEDICAL REPORT: RESULTS OF CHEST X-RAY EXAMINATION 

PA [posteroanterior] and lateral chest: The heart is enlarged in its transverse diameter. The lungs are 
fully expanded and free of active disease. 

Thoracic spine shows a scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine convex to the left. There is 50% wedge 
compression fracture of T6 and slight wedge compression fracture of T5. There is also anterior wedge 
compression fracture of T12. 

Lumbar spine shows 90% compression fractures of L1 and L3 with 30% compression fractures of L2 
and L5. All bones are markedly osteoporotic. There is calcification within the aortic arch. There are 
gallstones in the right upper quadrant. The findings in the spine are most compatible with osteoporotic 
compression fractures. During the procedure, the patient had a sickable [syncopal—this word was 
incorrectly transcribed!] episode and fell, striking her head. A skull series, done at no cost to the patient, 
shows no evidence of bony fracture. The pineal gland is calcified and has a midline location. The sella

SHORT CLINICAL CASE: OA OF THE KNEE 

A 65-year-old woman has been suffering from right knee joint stiffness, aching pain, and limited movement 
that is worse when she rises in the morning or after inactivity. She has been taking acetaminophen 
(Tylenol) and other NSAIDs (Motrin or Advil) to cope with the pain. 

An x-ray of her knees (see Figure 15-37A) shows deterioration of articular cartilage in the right knee 
with narrowing of the joint space. See left knee for comparison. Surgery is recommended for TKR and was 
performed (see Figure 15-37B and C). Follow-up x-ray (Figure 15-37D) shows the prosthesis in place. After 
a successful healing of the incision and removal of surgical clips, the patient had several months of PT and 
is walking normally without pain.

IN PERSON 


The following is a first-person narrative describing the experience 
of a woman of a “certain age” (in her words) who had a knee 
replacement procedure. 

Writing about my TKR [total knee replacement] more than two years 
after the operation is a singular experience. The main advantage of 
the passage of time is that—unlike psychic trauma, which seems to 
make inroads in the very structure of our brains—the release of the 
body from physical pain leaves amnesia in its wake. If that were not 
the case, no woman would ever have a second child—and no biped a 
second knee replacement. I know, even if my body doesn’t remember, that I endured much pain in the 
aftermath of the surgery and for many weeks thereafter. In fact, unlike most other physical ailments, joint 
replacement necessitates working through the pain in order to regain mobility. It’s when you feel you simply 
cannot bend it any more that you “start” working. ... So the pain is actually functional, and rather relentless. 
And yet I know—and accept—that sometime in the not-too-distant future, my left knee will follow my right 
in seeking a replacement. And that is because the osteoarthritis that depleted the first is depleting the second, 
and all my glucosamine-chondroitin pills, my quad exercises, my frequent massages, and even my nightshade-
free diet are at best only putting off by several months or a year the inevitable. 

I had endured many years of diminishing mobility in my right leg, alleviated somewhat by occasional 
cortisone shots and two arthroscopic surgeries (while stitching the second arthroscopic wound, my Israeli 
orthopedist said, “Nothing more to be done with this one ... next stop: total knee replacement!’) With all the 
research that I did in preparation for the Big Surgery, I became convinced—and still hold some version of this 
conviction—that TKR entails sawing the leg in two, like Houdini’s blonde assistant in the box, and then 
screwing it back together with better screws. It didn’t change that image much when my orthopedic surgeon 
at MGH [Massachusetts General Hospital], Dr. Dennis Burke, surely the best in his field in the universe, 
assured me that he is, in his spare time, a master carpenter. ... 

Okay—as this narrative demonstrates, the truth is a bit more complex and less grotesque. Still the procedure 
is very radical and involves major trauma to all the supporting muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. 
Hence a long period of recuperation is involved. I took advantage of the extra day that was offered to me at 
MGH (bless Medicare!) for a total hospitalization of five days, during which I had to learn how to perform the 
most basic functions in new ways. I found, after many trials, that a walker is preferable to crutches. Both are 
hard on the hands but the walker is more stable, and the attachable basket is a boon. 

For those of a “certain age” who are contemplating TKR, the question of where to do the rehab is crucial. 
If, as I did, you have the conditions to recover at home, that is preferable. The necessary conditions are, first, 
a partner or caregiver who is available 24/7 for the first few days and who doesn’t decide to take a prolonged 
vacation after that ... The second relates to the physical conditions at home. Preferably the living area should 
all be on one level; although climbing stairs becomes one of the protocols of physical therapy, it takes a while 
to get to that point, and one is not very steady until that time. Easy access to bathrooms and to other living 
areas is crucial. The third necessary condition is the availability of the physical therapist. Living in the summer 
and fall months in rural New Hampshire, I was fortunate to qualify for the services of the local VNA [Visiting 
Nurse Association], and a marvelous physical therapist visited me three times a week for about six weeks. In 
between visits, I worked hard to win her approval and, although it seemed at first like tackling Everest to lift 
my leg even one inch off the floor, let alone walk, within about six weeks I could drive, even if I was getting 
around outside with crutches; within two months I had regained good mobility, and six months later I was as 
good as new, and ever so grateful. ... 

Although I consider this procedure to be nothing short of miraculous, like any major elective surgery, one 
should not undertake it unless the pain of daily life outweighs its joys. ... when the doctors ask you about the 
pain, on a scale of 1 to 10, take them seriously. Don’t undergo this surgery until it hovers around 8 or 9 ... And 
then—well, enjoy the results!

(rheumatologist, orthopedist, chiropractor) decided to do “open” surgery. 
7. James has significant lower back pain radiating down his left leg. This condition is called 
(fibromyalgia, sciatica, talipes). MRI shows an intervertebral (disk, bunion, exostosis) impinging 
on spinal nerves at the (L5–S1, C2–C3, T3–T5) level. Bed rest produced no improvement. His 
orthopedist decided to perform a (tenorrhaphy, microdiskectomy, bunionectomy) to relieve 
pressure on his nerves. 
8. Bruce spent 2 weeks hiking and vacationing on Nantucket Island. A week later he developed a 
“bull’s-eye” rash on his chest (from a tick bite), fever, muscle pain, and a swollen, tender right 
ankle. His physician ordered a blood test that revealed (antigens, antibodies) to a spirochete 
bacterium. The physician told Bruce he had contracted (ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis, 
Lyme disease). 
9. Scott likes to eat rich food. Lately he has noticed pain and tenderness in his right toe, called 
(talipes, podagra, rickets), and also hard, lumpy deposits over his elbows. His doctor orders a 
serum uric acid test; the result is abnormally high, revealing (hemarthrosis, hyperuricemia, 
hypercalcemia), consistent with a diagnosis of (rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, 
osteoarthritis). 
10. Sara, a 70-year-old widow, has persistent midback pain, and her (CXR, ESR, EMG) shows 
compression fractures of her (scapula, femur, vertebrae) and thinning of her bones. A bone density 
scan confirms the diagnosis of (osteomyelitis, osteomalacia, osteoporosis), and her doctor 
prescribes calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax.

652 SKIN 


16 
INTRODUCTION 

The skin and its accessory structures (hair, nails, and glands) make up the integumentary 
system of the body. Integument means covering, and the skin (weighing 8 to 10 pounds and 
extending over an area of 22 square feet in an average adult) is the outer covering for the 
body. It is, however, more than a simple body covering. This complex system of specialized 
tissues contains glands that secrete several types of fluids, nerves that carry impulses, and 
blood vessels that aid in the regulation of the body temperature. 

The skin has many important functions: 

First, as a protective membrane over the entire body, the skin guards the deeper tissues 
of the body against excessive loss of water, salts, and heat and against invasion of pathogens 
and their toxins. Secretions from the skin are slightly acidic in nature, which contributes 
to the skin’s ability to prevent bacterial invasion. Specialized cells (Langerhans cells) react 
to the presence of antigens and have an immune function. 

Second, the skin contains two types of glands that produce important secretions. These 
glands in the skin are the sebaceous glands and the sweat glands. Sebaceous glands produce 
sebum, an oily secretion, and sweat glands produce sweat, a watery secretion. Sebum and 
sweat pass to the outer edges of the skin through ducts and leave the skin through openings, 
or pores. Sebum lubricates the surface of the skin, and sweat cools the body as it evaporates 
from the skin surface. 

Third, nerve fibers under the skin are receptors for sensations such as pain, temperature, 
pressure, and touch. Thus, the body’s adjustment to the environment depends on sensory 
messages relayed to the brain and spinal cord by sensitive nerve endings in the skin. 

Fourth, different tissues in the skin maintain body temperature (thermoregulation). 
Nerve fibers coordinate thermoregulation by carrying messages to the skin from heat 
centers in the brain that are sensitive to increases and decreases in body temperature. 
Impulses from these fibers cause blood vessels to dilate to bring blood to the surface and 
cause sweat glands to produce the watery secretion that carries heat away. 

ANATOMY OF THE SKIN 

Figure 16-1A shows three layers of the skin. Label them from the outer surface inward: 

Epidermis [1]—a thin, cellular membrane layer; containing keratin 

Dermis [2]—dense, fibrous, connective tissue layer; containing collagen 

Subcutaneous layer [3]—thick, fat-containing tissue 

EPIDERMIS 

The epidermis is the outermost, totally cellular layer of the skin. It is composed of squamous 
epithelium. Epithelium is the covering of both the internal and the external surfaces of the 
body. Squamous epithelial cells are flat and scale-like. In the outer layer of the skin, these 
cells are arranged in several layers (strata) to form stratified squamous epithelium. 

The epidermis lacks blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and connective tissue (elastic fibers, 
cartilage, fat) and is therefore dependent on the deeper dermis layer and its rich network 
of capillaries for nourishment. In fact, oxygen and nutrients seep out of the capillaries in 
the dermis, pass through tissue fluid, and supply nourishment to the lower layers of the 
epidermis. 

Figure 16-1B illustrates the multilayered cells of the epidermis. The deepest layer is 
called the basal layer [4]. The cells in the basal layer are constantly growing and multiplying 
and are the source of all the other cells in the epidermis. As the basal layer cells divide, they 



SKIN 653 
16 
are pushed upward and away from the blood supply of the dermal layer by a steady stream 
of younger cells. In their movement toward the most superficial layer of the epidermis, 
called the stratum corneum [5], the cells flatten, shrink, lose their nuclei, and die, becoming 
filled with a hard protein material called keratin. The cells are then called keratinocytes, 
reflecting their composition of keratin. Finally, within 3 to 4 weeks after beginning as a 
basal cell in the deepest part of the epidermis, the keratinized cell is sloughed off from the 
surface of the skin. The epidermis is thus constantly renewing itself, with cells dying at the 
same rate at which they are replaced. 
The basal layer of the epidermis contains special cells called melanocytes [6]. Melanocytes 
contain a pigment called melanin that is transferred to other epidermal cells and gives 
color to the skin. The number of melanocytes in all human races is the same, but the 
amount of melanin within each cell accounts for the color differences among the races. 
Individuals with darker skin possess more melanin within the melanocytes, not a greater 
number of melanocytes. Individuals who are incapable of forming melanin are called 
albinos. Skin and hair are white. In albinos, eye color varies from red to blue to brown, 
depending on the amount of melanin present in the iris (pigmented portion of the eye). 
Occulocutaneous albinism affects eyes, skin, and hair, while ocular albinism affects the 
eyes only.

Types of Melanin: Eumelanin and Pheomelanin 
Eumelanin (eu- = true) is more common and is a brown-black pigment. Pheomelanin (pheo- = dusky) is a red-yellow 
pigment. People with darker skin have more eumelanin, whereas people with lighter skin have more pheomelanin. 
Pheomelanin is a photo-sensitizer (doesn’t protect the skin from damaging ultraviolet rays) and makes lighter-skinned individuals 
more susceptible to skin cancer.


654 SKIN

Melanin production increases with exposure to strong ultraviolet light, and this creates 
a suntan, which is a protective response. When the melanin cannot absorb all of the 
ultraviolet rays, the skin becomes sunburned and inflamed (redness, swelling, and pain). 
Over a period of years, excessive exposure to sun tends to cause wrinkles, permanent 
pigmentary changes, and even cancer of the skin. Because dark-skinned people have more 
melanin, they acquire fewer wrinkles and they are less likely to develop the types of skin 
cancer that are associated with ultraviolet light exposure. 

DERMIS 

The dermis, directly below the epidermis, is composed of blood and lymph vessels and nerve 
fibers, as well as the accessory organs of the skin, which are the hair follicles, sweat glands, 
and sebaceous glands. To support the elaborate system of nerves, vessels, and glands, the 
dermis contains connective tissue cells and fibers that account for the extensibility and 
elasticity of the skin. 

The dermis is composed of interwoven elastic and collagen fibers. Collagen (colla = glue) 
is a fibrous protein material found in bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as in 
the skin. It is tough and resistant but also flexible. In the infant, collagen is loose and 
delicate; it becomes harder as the body ages. During pregnancy, overstretching of the skin 
with weight gain may break the elastic fibers, resulting in linear markings called striae 
(“stretch marks”) on the woman’s abdomen and elsewhere. Collagen fibers support and 
protect the blood and nerve networks that pass through the dermis. Collagen diseases affect 
connective tissues of the body. Examples of these connective tissue collagen disorders are 
systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma. 

SUBCUTANEOUS LAYER 

The subcutaneous layer (epidermis and dermis are the cutaneous layers) specializes in the 
formation of fat. Adipocytes (fat cells) are predominant in the subcutaneous layer, and they 
manufacture and store large quantities of fat. Obviously, fat deposition varies in different 
areas of the body and among individual people. Functionally, this layer of the skin is 
important in protection of the deeper tissues of the body, as a heat insulator, and for energy 
storage. 

ACCESSORY STRUCTURES OF THE SKIN 

HAIR 

A hair fiber is composed of a tightly fused meshwork of cells filled with the hard protein 
called keratin. Hair growth is similar to the growth of the epidermal layer of the skin. Deep-
lying cells in the hair root (Figure 16-2) produce keratinized cells that move upward 
through hair follicles (sacs within which each hair fiber grows). Melanocytes (see Figure 
16-2) are located at the root of the hair follicle, and they donate the melanin pigment to the 
cells of the hair fiber. 

Of the 5 million hairs on the body, about 100,000 are on the head. They grow about . 
inch (1.3 cm) per month. Cutting the hair has no effect on its rate of growth. 

What causes hair color? 


Concentration of eumelanin and pheomelanin cause the variations in hair color. For example: 

. Black hair = high levels of black eumelanin 
. Brown hair = high levels of brown eumelanin 
. Blond hair = low levels of black eumelanin 
. Red hair = high levels of pheomelanin 
. Grey hair = low concentration of eumelanin and pheomelanin 


SKIN 655 
16 
NAILS 
Nails are hard keratin plates covering the dorsal surface of the last bone of each toe and 
finger. They are composed of keratinocytes that are cemented together tightly and can 
extend indefinitely unless cut or broken. A nail grows in thickness and length as a result of 
division of cells in the region of the nail matrix, which is at the base (proximal portion) of 
the nail plate. 
Fingernails grow about 1 mm per week, which means that they can regrow in 3 to 
5 months. Toenails grow more slowly than fingernails; it takes 12 to 18 months for toenails 
to be replaced completely. 
The lunula is a semilunar (half-moon–shaped) whitish region at the base of the nail 
plate. It generally can be seen in the thumbnail of most people and is evident to varying 
degrees in other fingernails. Air mixed in with keratin and cells rich in nuclei give the 
lunula its whitish color. The cuticle, a narrow band of epidermis (layer of keratin), is at the 
base and sides of the nail plate. The paronychium is the soft tissue surrounding the nail 
border. Figure 16-3A illustrates the anatomic structure of a nail. 
Nail growth and appearance commonly alter during systemic disease. For example, 
grooves in nails may occur with high fevers and serious illness, and spoon nails (flattening 
of the nail plate) develop in iron deficiency anemia. Onycholysis (onych/o = nail) is the 
loosening of the nail plate with separation from the nail bed (Figure 16-3B). It may occur 
with infection of the nail and is often seen in psoriasis.

GLANDS 

Sebaceous Glands 

Sebaceous glands are located in the dermal layer of the skin over the entire body, with the 
exception of the palms (hands), soles (feet), and lips. They secrete an oily substance called 
sebum. Sebum, containing lipids, lubricates the skin and minimizes water loss. Sebaceous 
glands are closely associated with hair follicles, and their ducts open into the hair follicle 
through which the sebum is released. Figure 16-4 shows the relationship of the sebaceous 
gland to the hair follicle. The sebaceous glands are influenced by sex hormones, which 
cause them to hypertrophy at puberty and atrophy in old age. Increased production of 
sebum during puberty contributes to blackhead (comedo) formation and acne in some 
people. 

Sweat Glands 

Sweat glands (the most common type are eccrine sweat glands) are tiny, coiled glands 
found on almost all body surfaces (about 2 million in the body). They are most numerous 
in the palm of the hand (3000 glands per square inch) and in the sole of the foot. As 
illustrated in Figure 16-4, the coiled eccrine sweat gland originates deep in the dermis and 
straightens out to extend up through the epidermis. The tiny opening on the surface is 
a pore. 

Sweat, or perspiration, is almost pure water, with dissolved materials such as salt making 
up less than 1% of the total composition. It is colorless and odorless. The odor produced 
when sweat accumulates on the skin is caused by the action of bacteria on the sweat. 

Sweat cools the body as it evaporates into the air. Perspiration is controlled by the 
sympathetic nervous system, whose nerve fibers are activated by the heart regulatory center 
in the hypothalamic region of the brain, which stimulates sweating.

SKIN 657 

A special variety of sweat gland, active only from puberty onward and larger than the 
ordinary kind, is concentrated in a few areas of the body near the reproductive organs and 
in the armpits. These glands (apocrine sweat glands) secrete an odorless sweat, containing 
substances easily broken down by bacteria on the skin. The bacterial waste products produce 
a characteristic human body odor. The milk-producing mammary gland is another type of 
apocrine gland; it secretes milk after the birth of a child.

Is Botox Cosmetic Safe? 

Botox Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxin A) has been FDA approved since 2002, for cosmetic use to the brow and facial frown 
lines. Over a million patients have been treated with Botox Cosmetic, and there have been no reported fatal or permanent 
adverse effects related to its use. Botox Cosmetic works by blocking the connection between nerves and muscles. Muscles do 
not contract, thus preventing lines and wrinkles in the skin. When injected in small doses directly into the muscle, Botox 
Cosmetic can reduce specific facial lines for several months. 

The FDA has also approved injectable dermal fillers for deep facial wrinkles and folds. These include Restylane, Perlane, 
Juvederm, and Radiesse. New additional neuromodulators similar to Botox Cosmetic are also available: Xeomin 
(incobotulinumtoxin A) and Dysport (abobotulinumtoxin A).

PATHOLOGY 

CUTANEOUS LESIONS 

A lesion is an area of abnormal tissue anywhere on or in the body. It may be caused by disease or trauma 
(external forces). The following terms describe common skin lesions, which are illustrated in Figure 16-8A to L. 

16 
A. crust Collection of dried serum and cellular debris. 
A scab is a crust. It forms from the drying of a body exudate, as in eczema, 
impetigo, and seborrhea. 
B. cyst Thick-walled, closed sac or pouch containing fluid or semisolid 
material. 
Examples of cysts are the pilonidal cyst, which is found over the sacral area of the 
back in the midline and contains hairs (pil/o = hair, nid/o = nest); and a sebaceous 
cyst, a collection of yellowish, cheesy sebum commonly found on the scalp, vulva, 
and scrotum. 
C. erosion Wearing away or loss of epidermis. 
Erosions do not penetrate below the dermoepidermal junction. They occur as a 
result of inflammation or injury and heal without scarring. 
D. fissure Groove or crack-like sore. 
An anal fissure is a break in the skin lining of the anal canal. 
E. macule Flat lesion measuring less than 1 cm in diameter. 
Freckles, tattoo marks, and flat moles are examples. A patch is a large macule, 
greater than 1 cm in diameter. 
F. nodule Solid, round or oval elevated lesion 1 cm or more in diameter. 
An enlarged lymph node and solid growths are examples. 
G. papule Small (less than 1 cm in diameter), solid elevation of the skin. 
Pimples are examples of papules. Papules may become confluent (run together) 
and form plaques, which are elevated flat lesions. 
H. polyp Growth extending from the surface of mucous membrane. 
Polyps (a type of papule) commonly are found in the nose and sinuses, colon, 
urinary bladder, and uterus. 
I. pustule Papule containing pus. 
A pustule is a small abscess (collection of pus) on the skin. 
J. ulcer Open sore on the skin or mucous membranes (deeper than an erosion). 
Decubitus ulcers (bedsores) are caused by pressure that results from lying in one 
position (Latin decubitus means lying down). Pressure ulcers usually involve loss 
of tissue substance and pus or exudate formation. 
K. vesicle Small collection (papule) of clear fluid (serum); blister. 
Vesicles form in burns, allergies, and dermatitis. A bulla (plural: bullae) is a large 
vesicle. 
L. wheal Smooth, edematous (swollen) papule or plaque that is redder or paler 
than the surrounding skin. 
Wheals may be papular, as in a mosquito bite, or may involve a wide area, as in 
allergic reactions. Wheals often are accompanied by itching and are seen in hives, 
anaphylaxis, and insect bites.

664 SKIN 


SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS 
alopecia Absence of hair from areas where it normally grows. 
Alopecia, or baldness, may be hereditary (usual progressive loss of scalp hair in 
men) or it may be caused by disease, injury, or treatment (chemotherapy) or may 
occur with old age. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease in which hair falls 
out in patches without scarring or inflammation (Figure 16-9A). 
ecchymosis, ecchymoses Bluish-purplish mark (bruise) on the skin. 
Ecchymoses (ec-= out, chym/o = pour) are caused by hemorrhages into the skin 
from injury or spontaneous leaking of blood from vessels (Figure 16-9B). 
petechia, petechiae Small, pinpoint hemorrhage. 
Petechiae (p.-Tē-kē-ī) are smaller versions of ecchymoses (Figure 16-9C). Both 
ecchymoses and petechiae are forms of purpura (bleeding into the skin). 
pruritus Itching. 
Pruritus is a symptom associated with most forms of dermatitis and with other 
conditions as well. It arises as a result of stimulation of nerves in the skin by 
substances released in allergic reactions or by irritation caused by substances in 
the blood or by foreign bodies. 

ABNORMAL CONDITIONS 

acne Chronic papular and pustular eruption of the skin with increased 

production of sebum. 
Acne vulgaris (Latin vulgaris means ordinary) is caused by the buildup of sebum 
and keratin in the pores of the skin. A blackhead or open comedo (plural: 
comedones) is a sebum plug partially blocking the pore (Figure 16-10). If the 
pore becomes completely blocked, a whitehead (closed comedo) forms. Bacteria

muscle. C, Petechiae. 

 
Pruritus 

Be sure to spell pruritus correctly. It is a condition, not an inflammation (-itis). 



SKIN 665 
16 
in the skin break down the sebum, producing inflammation in the surrounding 
tissue. Papules, pustules, and cysts can thus form. Treatment consists of long-term 
antibiotic use and medications to decrease inflammation in the skin. Benzoyl 
peroxide and tretinoin (Retin-A) are topical medications used to prevent comedo 
formation; isotretinoin (Accutane) is used in severe cystic or treatment-resistant 
acne. 
burns Injury to tissues caused by heat contact. 
Burns may be caused by dry heat (fire), moist heat (steam or liquid), chemicals, 
lightning, electricity, or radiation. Burns usually are classified as follows: 
first-degree burns—superficial epidermal lesions, erythema, hyperesthesia, and 
no blisters. 
second-degree burns (partial-thickness burn injury)—epidermal and dermal 
lesions, erythema, blisters, and hyperesthesia (Figure 16-11A). 
third-degree burns (full-thickness burn injury)—epidermis and dermis are 
destroyed (necrosis of skin), and subcutaneous layer is damaged, leaving 
charred, white tissue (Figure 16-11B).

pinprick). 


666 SKIN 


cellulitis Diffuse, acute infection of the skin marked by local heat, redness, pain, 
and swelling. 
Abscess formation and tissue destruction can occur if appropriate antibiotic 
therapy is not given. Areas of poor lymphatic drainage are susceptible to this skin 
infection (Figure 16-12A). 
eczema (atopic dermatitis) Inflammatory skin disease with erythematous, papulovesicular, 
or papalosquamous lesions. 
This is a chronic or acute atopic dermatitis (rash often begins on face, hands, 
elbows, or knees) It is accompanied by intense pruritus and tends to occur in 
patients with a family history of allergic conditions. Treatment depends on the 
cause but usually includes the use of corticosteroids and moisturizers. See Figure 
16-12B. 
exanthematous viral diseases Rash (exanthem) of the skin due to a viral infection. 
Examples are rubella (German measles), rubeola (measles), and varicella 
(chickenpox). These conditions are no longer as common in children because of 
vaccination programs. However, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) is a common 
exanthematous viral disease. See Figure 16-13A. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is 
another common viral illness in children. See Figure 16-13B. 

16 
BA Cellulitis Eczema (atopic dermatitis) 
FIGURE 16-12 A, Cellulitis. Traveling on a safari in Botswana, a 63-year-old woman noticed swelling, redness, and pain in her 
lower leg. After a local physician prescribed oral antibiotics, she was advised to interrupt her trip to get IV antibiotics at a major 
hospital. Her cellulitis cleared in a week. B, Eczema (atopic dermatitis) in an infant. Greater than 70% of patients have a family 
history of other atopic conditions such as allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and asthma.

 
Atopic dermatitis 

Atopic means pertaining to atopy, which means out of place or unusual (a = no, top = place). It is a hyperallergic condition 
that may be hereditary, but contact with an allergen must occur before a hypersensitivity reaction can develop. 



SKIN 667 


BA Erythema infectiosum – fifth disease Hand-foot-and-mouth disease 
FIGURE 16-13 A, Erythema infectiosum - fifth disease. It is marked by fever and an erythematous rash that has a “slapped 
cheek” appearance on the face and later involving the arms, buttocks, and trunk. It is caused by a parvovirus. B, Hand-foot-andmouth 
disease. It is caused by an enterovirus. 

gangrene Death of tissue associated with loss of blood supply. 
In this condition, ischemia resulting from injury, inflammation, frostbite, diseases 
such as diabetes, or arteriosclerosis can lead to necrosis of tissue followed by 
bacterial invasion and putrefaction (proteins are decomposed by bacteria). See 
Figure 16-14A. 
impetigo Bacterial inflammatory skin disease characterized by vesicles, pustules, 
and crusted-over lesions. 
This is a contagious pyoderma (py/o = pus) and usually is caused by staphylococci 
or streptococci. Systemic use of antibiotics combined with proper cleansing of 
lesions is effective treatment. See Figure 16-14B. 

16 
BA ImpetigoGangrene 
FIGURE 16-14 A, Gangrene. B, Impetigo. 



668 SKIN 
psoriasis Chronic, recurrent dermatosis marked by itchy, scaly, red plaques 
covered by silvery gray scales (Figure 16-15A). 
Psoriasis commonly involves the forearms, knees, legs, and scalp. It is neither 
infectious nor contagious but is caused by an increased rate of growth of the basal 
layer of the epidermis. It is an autoinflammatory disease that can run in families. 
Treatment is palliative (relieving but not curing) and includes topical lubricants, 
keratolytics, and steroids. Systemic treatments include psoralen–ultraviolet A 
(PUVA) light therapy and immunomodulators. 
scabies Contagious, parasitic infection of the skin with intense pruritus. 
(Figure 16-15B) 
Scabies (from Latin scabere, to scratch) commonly affects areas such as the groin, 
nipples, and skin between the fingers. Treatment is with topical medicated cream 
to destroy the scabies mites (tiny parasites). 
scleroderma Chronic progressive disease of the skin and internal organs with 
hardening and shrinking of connective tissue. See Figure 16-16A. 
Fibrous scar-like tissue forms in the skin, and the heart, lungs, kidneys, and 
esophagus may be affected as well. Skin is thick, hard, and rigid, with areas of 
both depigmented and hyperpigmentation. It is an autoimmune disease for which 
palliative treatment consists of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents, 
antifibrotics, and physical therapy. 
systemic lupus Chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of collagen in skin, joints, 
erythematosus (SLE) and internal organs. 
Lupus, meaning wolf-like (the shape and color of the skin lesions resembled those 
in the bite of a wolf), produces a characteristic “butterfly” pattern of redness over 
the cheeks and nose. See Figure 16-16B. In more severe cases, the extent of 
erythema increases, and all exposed areas of the skin may be involved. Primarily a 
disease of females, lupus is an autoimmune disorder. High levels of certain 
antibodies are found in the patient’s blood. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive 
drugs are used to control symptoms. 
SLE should be differentiated from chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), 
which is a photosensitive, scaling, plaque-like eruption of the skin confined to 
the face, scalp, ears, chest, arms, and back, which heals with scarring. SLE should 
also be differentiated from lupus vulgaris, which refers to a cutaneous form of 
tuberculosis.

tinea Infection of the skin caused by a fungus. 

Tinea corporis, or ringworm, so called because the infection is in a ring-like 

pattern (Figure 16-17A), is highly contagious and causes severe pruritus. Other 

examples are tinea pedis (athlete’s foot, which affects the skin between the toes), 

tinea capitis (on the scalp), tinea barbae (affecting the skin under a beard), and 

tinea unguium (affecting the nails) (Figure 16-17B). Treatment is with antifungal 

agents. (Latin tinea means worm or moth—apparently the Romans thought that 

skin affected with tinea looked “moth-eaten.”)

the distal nail plate to turn yellow or white. Hyperkeratotic debris accumulates, causing the nail to separate from the nail bed 
(onycholysis). 

16 


670 SKIN 


urticaria (hives) Acute allergic reaction in which red, round wheals develop on the skin. 
Hives are often a reaction to foods (shellfish, nuts, eggs) or medicine. Histamine 
is released into the bloodstream, causing pruritus and edema (swelling). 
Angioedema is swelling around the face. Other substances and events that can 
trigger hives are animal dander, insect bites, and pollen. See Figure 16-18A. 
vitiligo Loss of pigment (depigmentation) in areas of the skin (milk-white 
patches). 
This is a form of leukoderma (Figure 16-18B). The skin changes result from an 
autoimmune process, and there is an increased association of vitiligo with 
autoimmune disorders such as thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. 
SKIN NEOPLASMS 
Benign Neoplasms 
callus Increased growth of cells in the keratin layer of the epidermis caused 
by pressure or friction. 
The feet (Figure 16-19A) and the hands are common sites for callus formation. A 
corn is a type of callus that develops a hard core (a whitish, cone-shaped central 
kernel). 
keloid Excess hypertrophied, thickened scar developing after trauma 
or surgical incision. 
Keloids (Figure 16-19B) result from excessive collagen formation in the skin 
during connective tissue repair. Keloids extend beyond the boundaries of the 
original injury. The term comes from the Greek kelis, meaning blemish. Surgical 
excision often is combined with intralesional steroid injections or ablative laser 
treatments. 
A normal scar left by a healed wound is called a cicatrix (S.K-.-tr.ks). 
keratosis Thickened and rough lesion of the epidermis; associated with aging or 
skin damage. 
Actinic keratosis is caused by long-term ultraviolet light exposure and is a 
precancerous lesion that can evolve into squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 
16-20A). Seborrheic keratosis is a benign lesion that results from overgrowth 
of the upper epidermis and is dark in color.

leukoplakia White, thickened patches on mucous membrane tissue of the tongue 
or cheek (evolves to squamous cell carcinoma). See Figure 16-5B, 
page 659. 
One type is a precancerous lesion that is common in smokers and may be caused 
by chronic inflammation. 
nevus, nevi Pigmented lesion of the skin (see Figure 16-20B). 
Nevi are commonly known as moles. Many are present at birth, but some are 
acquired. 
Dysplastic nevi are moles that have atypical cells and may progress to form a 
type of skin cancer called melanoma (see malignant melanoma). 
verruca, verrucae Epidermal growth (wart) caused by a virus. 
Verruca vulgaris (common wart) is the most frequent type of wart (Figure 
16-20C). Plantar warts occur on the soles of the feet, juvenile warts occur on the 
hands and face of children, and venereal warts occur on the genitals and around 
the anus. Warts are removed with acids, electrocautery, or freezing with liquid 
nitrogen (cryosurgery). If the virus remains in the skin, the wart frequently 
regrows.

672 SKIN 
Cancerous Lesions 
basal cell carcinoma Malignant tumor of the basal cell layer of the epidermis. 
This is the most frequent type of skin cancer. It is a slow-growing tumor that 
usually occurs on chronically sun-exposed skin, especially near or on the nose 
(Figure 16-21A). It almost never metastasizes. 
squamous cell carcinoma Malignant tumor of the squamous epithelial cells in the epidermis. 
This tumor may grow in places other than the skin, wherever squamous 
epithelium is found (mouth, larynx, bladder, esophagus, lungs). Actinic (sunrelated) 
keratoses are premalignant lesions in people with sun-damaged skin. 
Progression to squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 16-21B) may occur if lesions 
are not removed. Treatment is removal by surgical excision, cryotherapy, 
electrodesiccation and curettage, or radiotherapy. 
malignant melanoma Cancerous growth composed of melanocytes. 
This malignancy is attributed to a genetic predisposition and to exposure to 
ultraviolet light. Melanoma usually begins as a mottled, light brown to black 
macule with irregular borders (Figure 16-22). The lesion may turn shades of red, 
blue, and white and may crust on the surface and bleed. Melanomas may arise in 
preexisting moles (dysplastic nevi) and frequently appear on the upper back, 
lower legs, arms, head, and neck. 
Biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma, and prognosis is best 
determined by measuring tumor thickness in millimeters. 
Melanomas often metastasize to the lung, liver, bone, and brain. Treatment 
may include excision of the tumor, regional lymphadenectomy, chemotherapy/ 
immunotherapy, or radiotherapy. See the In Person story on page 677. 
Kaposi sarcoma Malignant, vascular, neoplastic growth characterized by cutaneous 
nodules. 
Frequently arising on the lower extremities, nodules range in color from deep 
pink to dark blue and purple. One form of this condition is associated with 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). See Figure 14-11, page 559.

LABORATORY TESTS AND CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

LABORATORY TESTS 
bacterial analyses Samples of skin are examined for presence of microorganisms. 
Purulent (pus-filled) material or exudate (fluid that accumulates) often is taken 
for examination. 
fungal tests Scrapings from skin lesions, hair specimens, or nail clippings are sent 
to a laboratory for culture and microscopic examination. 
The specimen also may be treated with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation 
and examined microscopically. A positive result on a KOH test reveals elements 
that indicate the presence of a fungal infection. 

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

cryosurgery 
Use of subfreezing temperature achieved with liquid nitrogen 
application to destroy tissue. 

curettage 
Use of a sharp dermal curette to scrape away a skin lesion. 

A curette is shaped like a spoon or scoop. 

electrodesiccation 
Tissue is destroyed by burning with an electric spark. 

This procedure is used along with curettage to remove and destroy small 
cancerous lesions with well-defined borders. 

Mohs surgery 
Thin layers of malignant tissue are removed, and each slice is 
examined under a microscope to check for adequate extent of the 
resection. 

Mohs surgery (also called Mohs micrographic surgery) is a specialized form of 
excision to treat basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and other 
tumors. See Figure 16-23.

skin biopsy Suspected malignant skin lesions are removed and examined 
microscopically by a pathologist. 
In a punch biopsy, a surgical instrument removes a core of tissue obtained by 
rotation of its sharp, circular edge. In a shave biopsy, tissue is excised using a cut 
parallel to the surface of the surrounding skin. 
skin test Substances are injected intradermally or applied to the skin, and 
results are observed. 
Skin tests are used to diagnose allergies and disease. In the patch test, an 
allergen-treated piece of gauze or filter paper is applied to the skin. If the skin 
becomes red or swollen, the result is positive. In the scratch test, several 
scratches are made in the skin, and a very minute amount of test material is 
inserted into the scratches. The Schick test (for diphtheria) and the Mantoux and 
purified protein derivative (PPD) tests (for tuberculosis) are other skin tests.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 

This section contains disease descriptions, a medical report, and a case report using terms that you have 
studied in this and previous chapters. Explanations of more difficult terms are added in brackets. 

DISEASE DESCRIPTIONS

 1. 
Candidiasis (Candida is a yeast-like fungus): This fungus is normally found on mucous membranes, 
skin, and vaginal mucosa. Under certain circumstances (excessive warmth and moisture; administration 
of antibiotics and corticosteroids; debilitated states; infancy), it can proliferate and cause localized 
or generalized mucocutaneous disease. Examples are paronychial lesions, lesions in areas of the 
body where the rubbing of opposed surfaces is common (groin, perianal, axillary, inframammary, 
and interdigital), thrush (white plaques attached to oral or vaginal mucous membranes), and 
vulvovaginitis. 
2. 
Cellulitis: This is a common nonsuppurative infection of connective tissue with severe inflammation 
of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin. Cellulitis appears on an extremity as a warm reddish 
area of tender edematous skin. A surgical wound, puncture, insect bite, skin ulcer, or patch 
of dermatitis is the usual means of entry for bacteria (most cases are caused by streptococci 
or Staphylococcus aureus). Therapy includes rest, elevation, hot wet packs, and antibiotics. Any 
cellulitis on the face should be given special attention because the infection may extend directly to the 
brain. 
3. 
Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma): This rare, chronic skin condition is caused by the 
infiltration of the skin by atypical lymphocytes. Contrary to its name (myc/o = fungus), it is not caused 
by a fungus but was formerly thought to be of fungal origin. It can manifest with generalized 
erythroderma or large, reddish, raised tumors that spread and ulcerate. In some cases, the malignant 
cells may involve lymph nodes and other organs. Treatment with cortisone ointments, topical nitrogen 
mustard, psoralen–ultraviolet light A (PUVA), and systemic retinoids or immunomodulators can be 
effective in controlling the disease. 
MEDICAL RECORD: FINDINGS ON DERMATOLOGIC EXAMINATION 

A wide variety of lesions are seen on the face, shoulders, and back. The predominant lesions are pustules

present on the face, especially along the midface. Inflammatory papules are present on the lower cheeks 
and chin. Large abscesses and ulcerated cysts are present over the upper shoulder area. Numerous scars 
are present over the face and upper back.

CASE REPORT: BASAL CELL CARCINOMA 

A 76-year-old woman noticed a 1-inch-diameter flaky patch on her scalp. Over a period of months, the 
lesion increased in size and became ulcerated, with the skull bone visible (Figure 16-24A). A biopsy was 
performed and pathologic examination revealed basal cell carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery was 
attempted but a CT study of the head/brain with contrast showed the likelihood of residual tumor extending 
into the skull (Figure 16-24B). 

Major surgery was performed to resect residual malignant tissue. A large portion of skull was removed 
and replaced with titanium mesh on which muscle from her back and skin from her leg were grafted. The 
primary surgical area healed well. Pathologic examination confirmed the presence of tumor invading the 
skull and underlying dura at the surgical margin. The patient is now receiving radiation therapy for 6 
weeks to treat the affected area. 

Commentary: Most basal cell carcinomas are small tumors that are easily removed by local surgery, 
such as Mohs. When treatment is delayed, however, they can become very large and require major 
surgical procedures with grafting. They can continue to grow locally and invade adjacent tissues, as 
occurred in this case.

IN PERSON 
This is a first-person account describing the course of metastatic 
melanoma. It is written by the husband of a patient. 

Mary Ann showed me the mole on her arm near her armpit and I 
knew immediately that this was not going to be a good thing. It was 
raised, red and black, irregular shape. That was more than 30 years 
ago, before the Internet, and no way to confirm our fear. Four days 
later the mole was excised, and within a week, we received confirmation 
that it was a melanoma. 

We had various opinions about the next step, but Mary Ann had 
always been convinced that you always go to a teaching hospital and 
find the experts. We selected a surgeon at Georgetown Hospital 
and she underwent a resection of an area on her arm that was about 


3 × 4 inches. The nodes in her armpit were also removed, which I 
questioned. If the cancer had spread to her nodes then it was already metastatic and, either way, she risked 
getting edema in her arm. Fortunately, there was no node involvement and she didn’t get edema. Again, with 
no Internet we had to spend several nights at the Library of Medicine trying to educate ourselves with what we 
were dealing with. We didn’t know about the classifications and TNM readings weren’t mentioned to us. We 
only knew the depth of the tumor and, relating that to the charts, we found implied a 30% to 40% five year 
survival rate. 

Living in anticipation of recurrence was extremely stressful. Mary Ann dwelled a lot on her demise despite 
my and her friends’ efforts to put on a happy face and trying to fill the days with distractions. Her 6 month 
chest x-rays and checkups gradually became less stressful, leaving us with the feeling that it was okay to enjoy 
life again. Two and a half years after her operation, that changed. A tumor showed up in her lung. Again she 
found the best thoracic surgeon in the area and had it removed. Six weeks later two small tumors appeared 
below her ribcage right where the drain from her operation had been. These were the first of many that 
appeared just below the dermis, in her abdomen, thigh, and back. This was over a period of about 8 months, 
and during this time Mary Ann entered her first trial in which she received an injectable, specific antigen that 
was designed to boost her immune system. Remarkably, Mary Ann the fighter began to emerge. With two preteen 
daughters to nurture, she put tumor removal and weekly injections on her to-do list. 

At this time, she was under increased stress dealing with the loss of her mother to a heart attack. During 
the funeral she complained of severe back pain, and when we returned home tests revealed metastases on her 
spinal cord. Again, she found the best neurological surgeon and had them removed. She had to relearn how to 
walk again and had barely begun to recover when her sisters called to tell her that her father had died of a 
heart attack. She knew even before I told her and, I remember her words: “Bring it on, give me all you’ve got, 
I can take it.” 

Shortly after his funeral she began to have “dancing spots” in her right eye, a sign of a metastatic brain 
tumor. Her oncologist was adamantly opposed to surgery. His advice was to stick to the protocol, and not put 
her through an operation because she would be dead in six months. Mary Ann and I believed that the drug 
protocol alone was not going to give her more time. She was determined to have the surgery and subsequent 
radiation. Recovery was difficult and she lost her hair in the radiation field, but it was a fortunate time in that 
she met Davi Chabner, who was to be her best friend and catalyst for enjoying life again. A year later there was 
another brain tumor, which was removed and followed by more radiation. She then took part in a brief trial 
using monoclonal antibodies. A couple of more surface tumors were removed, but then: no more! Remission! 
Life was good. Vacations, golf with friends, visits to college to see our daughters, trips to see Mary Ann’s sisters, 
all was a pleasant blend of what you do with the time you have. Although she had a multitude of friends that 
she saw often, it was Mary Ann’s time with Davi and her husband that kept her enthused over every day.

Five years later Mary Ann woke up with night sweats and a low-grade fever that wouldn’t go away. Our worst 
fears were realized. A large, inoperable tumor was in her spleen. Less than 4 months later she died. Looking 
back, she went through a lot during her 9-year ordeal, but she beat the odds, and through sheer willpower 
enjoyed her time to the fullest. That was over 20 years ago, and to this day, I still meet people who remember 
her fondly and remark that she was one of their best friends. That was Mary Ann. No matter what she was 
going through she was still interested in your life. 

Bob Rowe is a retired software engineer and avid golfer. 

Note: In the last two years, therapy for metastatic melanoma has been radically improved by a new targeted agent, Vemurafenib, and 
new monoclonal antibodies that promote an immune response to the tumor.

696 SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 


17 
INTRODUCTION 

The eye and the ear are sense organs, like the skin, taste buds, and olfactory (centers of 
smell in the nose) regions. As such, they are receptors whose sensitive cells may be activated 
by a particular form of energy or stimulus in the external or internal environment. The 
sensitive cells in the eye and ear respond to the stimulus by initiating a series of nerve 
impulses along sensory nerve fibers that lead to the brain. 

No matter what stimulus affects a particular receptor, the resulting sensation is 
determined by regions in the brain connected to that receptor. Thus, mechanical injury 
that stimulates receptor cells in the eye and the ear may produce sensations of vision 
(flashes of light) and sound (ringing in the ears). If a workable connection could be made 
between the sensitive receptor cells of the ear and the area in the brain associated with 
sight, it would be possible to “see” sounds. 

Figure 17-1 reviews the general pattern of events when such stimuli as light and sound 
are applied to sense organs such as the eye and the ear. 

THE EYE 

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 

Label Figure 17-2 as you read the following: 

Light rays enter the central dark opening of the eye, the pupil [1], which is surrounded 
by the colored portion of the eye, or iris (see the photo inset). The conjunctiva [2] is a 
membrane lining the inner surfaces of the eyelids and anterior portion of the eyeball over 
the white of the eye. The conjunctiva is clear and almost colorless except when blood vessels 
are dilated. Dust and smoke may cause the blood vessels to dilate, giving the conjunctiva a 
reddish appearance—commonly known as bloodshot eyes. 

Before entering the eye through the pupil, light passes through the cornea [3]. The 
cornea is a fibrous, transparent tissue that extends like a dome over the pupil and iris. The 
function of the cornea is to bend, or refract, the rays of light so they are focused properly 
on the sensitive receptor cells in the posterior region of the eye. The normal, healthy cornea 
is avascular (has no blood vessels) but receives nourishment from blood vessels near its 
junction with the opaque white of the eye, the sclera [4]. Corneal transplants for people 
with scarred or opaque corneas are often successful because antibodies responsible for 
rejection of foreign tissue usually do not reach the avascular, transplanted corneal tissue. 
The sclera is a fibrous layer under the conjunctiva. It extends from the cornea on the 
anterior surface of the eyeball to the optic nerve in the back of the eye. 

The choroid [5] is a dark brown membrane inside the sclera. It contains many blood 
vessels that supply nutrients to the eye. The choroid is continuous with the pigment-
containing iris [6] and the ciliary body [7] on the anterior surface of the eye. The choroid, 
iris, and ciliary body are known as the uvea of the eye. 

The iris is the colored portion of the eye (it can appear blue, green, hazel, gray, or brown), 
which has a circular opening in the center that forms the pupil. Muscles of the iris constrict

the pupil in bright light and dilate the pupil in dim light, thereby regulating the amount of 
light entering the eye. 
The ciliary body surrounds the outside of the lens [8] in a circular fashion for 360 degrees. 
There are fine thread-like attachments (zonules) that connect the ciliary body and the lens 
and allow the muscles in the ciliary body to adjust the shape and thickness of the lens. 
These changes in the shape of the lens cause refraction of light rays. Refraction is the 
bending of rays as they pass through the cornea, lens, and other tissues. Muscles of the 
ciliary body produce flattening of the lens (for distant vision) and thickening and rounding 
of the lens (for close vision). This refractory adjustment to focus on an object from far to 
near is called accommodation. 
Besides regulating the shape of the lens, the ciliary body also secretes a fluid called 
aqueous humor, which is found in the anterior chamber [9] of the eye. Aqueous humor 
maintains the shape of the anterior portion of the eye and nourishes the structures in that 
region. The fluid is constantly produced and leaves the eye through a canal that carries 
it into the bloodstream. Another cavity of the eye is the vitreous chamber, which is a 
large region behind the lens filled with a soft, jelly-like material, the vitreous humor [10]. 
Vitreous humor maintains the shape of the eyeball and is not constantly re-formed. Its 
escape (due to trauma or surgical damage) may result in significant damage to the eye, 
leading to possible retinal damage and blindness. Both the aqueous and the vitreous humors 
further refract light rays.

698 SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 


The retina [11] is the thin, delicate, and sensitive nerve layer of the eye. As light energy, 
in the form of waves, travels through the eye, it is refracted (by the cornea, lens, and fluids), 
so that it focuses on sensitive receptor cells of the retina called the rods and cones. There 
are approximately 6.5 million cones and 120 million rods in the retina. The cones function 
in bright levels of light and are responsible for color and central vision. There are three 
types of cones, each stimulated by one of the primary colors in light (red, green, or blue). 
Most cases of color blindness affect either the green or the red receptors, so that the two 
colors cannot be distinguished from each other. Rods function at reduced levels of light and 
are responsible for peripheral vision. 

When light rays are focused on the retina, a chemical change occurs in the rods and 
cones, initiating nerve impulses that then travel from the eye to the brain via the optic 
nerve [12]. The region in the eye where the optic nerve meets the retina is called the optic 
disc [13]. Because there are no light receptor cells in the optic disc, it is known as the blind 
spot of the eye. The macula [14] is a small, oval, yellowish area adjacent to the optic disc. It 
contains a central depression called the fovea centralis [15], which is composed largely of 
cones and is the location of the sharpest vision in the eye. If a portion of the fovea or macula 
is damaged, vision is reduced and central-vision blindness occurs. Figure 17-3 shows the 
retina of a normal eye as seen through an ophthalmoscope. The fundus of the eye is this 
posterior, inner part that is visualized through the ophthalmoscope. 

Figure 17-4 illustrates what happens when you look at an object and “see” it. If an object 
is in your left visual field (purple area), sensitive cells—rods and cones—in the right half of

visual field are projected into the left visual cerebral cortex. 

each retina (labeled A in the figure) are stimulated. Similarly, if an object is in your right 
visual field (orange color), rods and cones are stimulated in the left half of each retina. 
Nervous impulses then travel along optic nerve fibers from each retina and then merge to 
form the optic chiasm (B). Here, medial or nasal optic nerve fibers cross and temporal 
fibers do not. Thus, fibers from the right half of each retina (purple color) form an optic 
tract (C) leading, via the thalamus (relay center), to the right visual cerebral cortex (D). 
Similarly, fibers from the left half of each retina (orange color) form an optic tract leading 
to the left visual cerebral cortex (D). Images (one from each eye) are then fused in the 
occipital lobe of the brain, producing a single visual sensation with the three-dimensional 
effect. This is binocular vision. 

Brain damage to nerve cells in the right visual cerebral cortex (such as in a stroke) causes 
loss of vision in the left visual field (purple), whereas damage in the left cerebral cortex 
causes loss of vision in the right visual field (gold). This loss of vision, which occurs in both 
eyes, on the contralateral (opposite side) visual field is called hemianopsia (hemi-means 
half, an-means without, -opsia means vision). In the right eye, the loss is on the left nasal 
visual field, and in the left eye, the loss is on the left temporal visual field.

the brain.

VOCABULARY—THE EYE 
This list reviews many new terms related to the eye introduced in the text. Short definitions reinforce your 
understanding of the terms. Refer to the Pronunciation of Terms on page 740 for help with unfamiliar or 
difficult words. 

accommodation Normal adjustment of the eye to focus on objects from far to near. The 
ciliary body adjusts the lens (rounding it) and the pupil constricts. 
When the eye focuses from near to far, the ciliary body flattens the lens 
and the pupil dilates. 
anterior chamber Area behind the cornea and in front of the lens and iris. It contains 
aqueous humor. 
aqueous humor Fluid produced by the ciliary body and found in the anterior chamber. A 
humor (Latin humidus means moist) is any body fluid, including blood 
and lymph. 


SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 701

biconvex Consisting of two surfaces that are rounded, elevated, and curved 
evenly, like part of a sphere. The lens of the eye is a biconvex body. 
choroid Middle, vascular layer of the eye, between the retina and the sclera. 
ciliary body Structure surrounding the lens that connects the choroid and iris. It 
contains ciliary muscles, which control the shape of the lens, and it 
secretes aqueous humor. 
cone Photoreceptor cell in the retina that transforms light energy into a 
nerve impulse. Cones are responsible for color and central vision. 
conjunctiva Delicate membrane lining the undersurface of the eyelids and covering 
the anterior eyeball. 
cornea Fibrous transparent layer of clear tissue that extends over the anterior 
portion of the eyeball. Derived from Latin corneus, meaning horny, 
perhaps because as it protrudes outward, it was thought to resemble a 
horn. 
fovea centralis Tiny pit or depression in the retina that is the region of clearest vision. 
fundus of the eye Posterior, inner part of the eye. 
iris Pigmented (colored) layer that opens and closes to allow more or less 
light into the eye. The central opening of the iris is the pupil.

(refracts) light rays to bring them into focus on the retina. 
macula Yellowish region on the retina lateral to and slightly below the optic 
disc; contains the fovea centralis, which is the area of clearest vision. 
optic chiasm Point at which optic nerve fibers cross in the brain (Latin chiasma 
means crossing). 
optic disc Region at the back of the eye where the optic nerve meets the retina. It 
is the blind spot of the eye because it contains only nerve fibers, no rods 
or cones, and is thus insensitive to light. 
optic nerve Cranial nerve carrying impulses from the retina to the brain (cerebral 
cortex). 
pupil Central opening of the eye, surrounded by the iris, through which light 
rays pass. It appears dark. 
refraction Bending of light rays by the cornea, lens, and fluids of the eye to bring 
the rays into focus on the retina. Refract means to break (-fract) back 
(re-).

Here, -oma means mass or collection of fluid (aqueous humor). 
The term comes from the dull gray-green color of the affected eye 
in advanced cases. See page 709. 
mi/o smaller, less miosis ____________________________________________ 
Contraction of the pupil. A miotic is a drug (such as pilocarpine)

ERRORS OF REFRACTION 


hyperopia _________________________________________ 

Hypermetropia (farsightedness). 

hemianopsia _______________________________________ 

Absence of vision in half of the visual field (space of vision of each 
eye). Stroke victims frequently have damage to the brain on one 
side of the visual cortex and experience hemianopsia (the visual 
loss is in the right or the left visual field of both eyes). 

esotropia __________________________________________ 

Inward (eso-) turning of an eye. Exotropia is an outward turning 
of an eye. These conditions are examples of strabismus (defect in 
eye muscles so that both eyes cannot be focused on the same 
point at the same time). 

17 
astigmatism Defective curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye. 

This problem results from one or more abnormal curvatures of the cornea or lens. 
This causes light rays to be unevenly and not sharply focused on the retina, so that 
the image is distorted. A cylindrical lens placed in the proper position in front of 
the eye can correct this problem (Figure 17-8A). 

hyperopia (hypermetropia) Farsightedness. 

As Figure 17-8B illustrates, the eyeball in this condition is too short or the 
refractive power of the lens is too weak. Parallel rays of light tend to focus behind 
the retina, which results in a blurred image. A convex lens (thicker in the middle 
than at the sides) bends the rays inward before they reach the cornea, and thus the 
rays can be focused properly on the retina. 

myopia Nearsightedness. 

In myopia 


the eyeball is too long (front to back) or the refractive power of the 
lens so strong that light rays do not properly focus on the retina. The image 
perceived is blurred because the light rays are focused in front of the retina. 
Concave glasses (thicker at the periphery than in the middle) correct this 
condition because the lenses spread the rays out before they reach the cornea, so 
that they can be properly focused directly on the retina (Figure 17-8C). 
Myopia/Miotic 

In this term, my- comes from Greek myein, meaning to shut, referring to the observation that myopic persons frequently peer 
through half-closed eyelids. Don’t confuse myopia with miotic, which is a drug that contracts the pupil of the eye. 



SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 707 
17 
presbyopia Impairment of vision as a result of old age. 
With increasing age, loss of elasticity of the ciliary body impairs its ability to adjust 
the lens for accommodation to near vision. The lens of the eye cannot become fat 
to bend the rays coming from near objects (less than 20 feet). The light rays focus 
behind the retina, as in hyperopia. Therefore, a convex lens is needed to refract the 
rays coming from objects closer than 20 feet.

Management for Positive Outcomes, 7th ed., Philadelphia, Saunders, 2005.) 

PATHOLOGY—THE EYE 

cataract 
Clouding of the lens, causing decreased vision (Figure 17-9). 
A cataract is a type of degenerative eye disease (protein in the lens aggregates 
and clouds vision) and is linked to the process of aging (senile cataracts). Some 
cataracts, however, are present at birth, and others occur with diabetes mellitus, 
ocular trauma, and prolonged high-dose corticosteroid administration. Vision 
appears blurred as the lens clouds over and becomes opaque. Lens cloudiness can 
be seen with an ophthalmoscope or the naked eye. Surgical removal of the lens 
with implantation of an artificial lens behind the iris (the preferred position) is the 
method of treatment. If an intraocular lens cannot be inserted, the patient may 
wear eyeglasses or contact lenses to help refraction. 

chalazion 
Small, hard, cystic mass (granuloma) on the eyelid. 

Chalazions (k.-Lā-zē-.nz) are formed as a result of chronic inflammation of a 
sebaceous gland (meibomian gland) along the margin of the eyelid (Figure 17-10). 
They often require incision and drainage.

diabetic retinopathy Retinal effects of diabetes mellitus include microaneurysms, 
hemorrhages, dilation of retinal veins, and neovascularization (new 
blood vessels form in the retina). 
Macular edema occurs as fluid leaks from blood vessels into the retina and vision 
is blurred. Exudates (fluid leaking from the blood) appear in the retina as yellowwhite 
spots. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy (see pages 715 and 716) are 
helpful for patients in whom hemorrhaging has been severe. The latest treatment 
for diabetic macular edema involves injecting medications into the vitreous jelly. 
Corticosteroids and agents that promote regression of abnormal blood vessels are 
used to decrease fluid leakage and neovascularization. 
glaucoma Increased intraocular pressure results in damage to the retina and optic 
nerve with loss of vision. 
Intraocular pressure is elevated because of the inability of aqueous humor to drain 
from the eye and enter the bloodstream. Normally, aqueous humor is formed by 
the ciliary body, flows into the anterior chamber, and leaves the eye at the angle 
where the cornea and the iris meet. If fluid cannot leave or too much fluid is 
produced, pressure builds up in the anterior chamber (Figure 17-11). 
Glaucoma is diagnosed by means of tonometry (see page 713), with an 
instrument applied externally to the eye after administration of local anesthetic. 
Acute glaucoma is marked by extreme ocular pain, blurred vision, redness of the 
eye, and dilation of the pupil. If untreated, it causes blindness. Chronic glaucoma 
may produce no symptoms initially. A patient with glaucoma may experience a 
gradual loss of peripheral vision, with headaches, blurred vision, and halos around 
bright lights. 
Administration of drugs to lower intraocular pressure can control the condition. 
Sometimes, laser therapy is used to treat narrow-angle glaucoma by creating a 
hole in the periphery of the iris (iridotomy), which allows aqueous humor to flow 
more easily out of the anterior chamber and reduces intraocular pressure. Laser 
therapy (trabeculoplasty) for chronic open-angle glaucoma causes scarring in the 
drainage angle, which improves aqueous humor outflow and reduces intraocular 
pressure.

hordeolum (stye or sty) 
Localized, purulent, inflammatory staphylococcal infection of 
a sebaceous gland in the eyelid. 

Hot compresses may help localize the infection and promote drainage. In some 
cases, surgical incision may be necessary. Latin hordeolum (h.r-Dē-ō-l.m) means 
barley corn. See Table 17-1 for a list of common eyelid abnormalities. 

macular degeneration 
Progressive damage to the macula of the retina. 

Macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. It 
causes severe loss of central vision (Figure 17-12). Peripheral vision (using the 
part of the retina that is outside the macular region) is retained. 

Macular degeneration occurs in both a “dry” and a “wet” form. The dry form 
(affecting about 85% of patients) is marked by atrophy and degeneration of retinal 
cells and deposits of clumps of extracellular debris, or drusen. The wet form 
results from development of new (neovascular) and leaky (exudative) blood vessels 
close to the macula. 

There is no treatment for the dry form of macular degeneration except 
attempting to slow the progression of the disease by taking vitamin and mineral 
supplements, and actions such as smoking cessation. Wet macular degeneration 
may be treated with laser photocoagulation of the leaking vessels and injection of 
medication into the vitreous jelly that promotes regression of abnormal blood

vessels. Unfortunately, in many cases, patients with wet macular degeneration 
have more severe vision loss, and success of treatment is limited. 

nystagmus Repetitive rhythmic movements of one or both eyes. 

Brain tumors or diseases of the inner ear may cause nystagmus. Nystagmus is 
normal in newborns. 

retinal detachment Two layers of the retina separate from each other. 

Trauma to the eye, head injuries, bleeding, scarring from infection, or shrinkage 
of the vitreous humor can produce holes or tears in the retina and result in the 
separation of layers. Patients often experience photopsia (bright flashes of light) 
and floaters (black spots or filmy shapes), which are vitreous clumps that detach 
from the retina. Later, they notice a shadow or curtain falling across the field of 
vision. In some cases, floaters may be a sign of a retinal hole, tear, or detachment 
caused by pigmented cells from the damaged retina or bleeding that has occurred 
as a result of a detachment. See the In Person story on page 726. 

Photocoagulation (making pinpoint burns to form scar tissue and seal holes) 
and cryotherapy (creating a “freezer burn” that forms a scar and knits a tear 
together) are used to repair smaller retinal tears. For larger retinal detachments, 
a scleral buckle (see page 715) made of silicone is sutured to the sclera directly 
over the detached portion of the retina to push the two retinal layers together. 
In selected retinal detachments, a procedure called pneumatic retinopexy is 
performed. A gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity to put pressure on the 
area of retinal tear until the retina is reattached. 

strabismus Abnormal deviation of the eye. 

A failure of the eyes to look in the same direction because of weakness of a muscle 
controlling the position of one eye (Figure 17-13). Different forms of strabismus 
include esotropia (one eye turns inward; cross-eyed), exotropia (one eye turns 
outward; wall-eyed), hypertropia (upward deviation of one eye), and hypotropia 
(downward deviation of one eye). Treatment may include medications in the form 
of eye drops, corrective lenses, eye exercises with patching of the normal eye, or 
surgery to restore muscle balance. 

In children, strabismus may lead to amblyopia (partial loss of vision or lazy eye). 
Amblyopia is reversible until the retina is fully developed, at the age of 7 to 10 
years. When strabismus develops in an adult, diplopia (double vision) is a common 
problem.

in the macular area of the retina (Figure 17-14). 
ophthalmoscopy Visual examination of the interior of the eye. 
Ideally, the pupil is dilated and the physician holds the ophthalmoscope close 
to the patient’s eye, shining the light into the back of the eye (Figure 17-15). 
Ophthalmologists may also use special lenses in conjunction with a hand lamp or 
a slit lamp (Figure 17-16).

permit examination of the fundus, as with a direct ophthalmoscope. 


visual acuity test Clarity of vision is assessed (Figure 17-17A). 
A patient reads from a Snellen chart at 20 feet (distance vision test). Visual acuity 
is expressed as a ratio, such as 20/20. The first number is the distance the patient 
is standing from the chart. The second number is the distance at which a person 
with normal vision could read the same line of the chart. If the best a patient can 
see is the 20/200 line, then at 20 feet the patient can see what a “healthy” eye sees 
at 200 feet. 
Mirrors are used so that measurements can be taken at less than 20 feet and still 
be equivalent to those for vision measured at 20 feet.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 


Sound waves are received by the outer ear, conducted to special receptor cells within the 
ear, and transmitted by those cells to nerve fibers that lead to the auditory region of the 
brain in the cerebral cortex. Sensations of sound are perceived within the nerve fibers of 
the cerebral cortex. 

Label Figure 17-22 as you read the following paragraphs describing the anatomy and 
physiology of the ear. 

The ear can be divided into three separate regions: outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. 
The outer and middle ears function in the conduction of sound waves through the ear, and 
the inner ear contains structures that receive the auditory waves and relay them to the 
brain. 

Outer Ear 

Sound waves enter the ear through the pinna, or auricle [1], which is the projecting part, 
or flap, of the ear. The external auditory meatus (auditory canal) [2] leads from the pinna 
and is lined with numerous glands that secrete a yellowish brown, waxy substance called 
cerumen. Cerumen lubricates and protects the ear. 

Middle Ear 

Sound waves travel through the auditory canal and strike a membrane between the outer 
and the middle ear. This is the tympanic membrane, or eardrum [3]. As the eardrum 
vibrates, it moves three small bones, or ossicles, that conduct the sound waves through the 
middle ear. These bones, in the order of their vibration, are the malleus [4], the incus [5], 
and the stapes [6]. As the stapes moves, it touches a membrane called the oval window [7], 
which separates the middle from the inner ear. 

Before proceeding with the pathway of sound conduction and reception into the inner 
ear, an additional structure that affects the middle ear should be mentioned. The auditory 



SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 717 


or eustachian tube [8] is a canal leading from the middle ear to the pharynx. It normally is 
closed but opens on swallowing. In an efficient way, this tube can prevent damage to the 
eardrum and shock to the middle and inner ears. Normally the pressure of air in the middle 
ear is equal to the pressure of air in the external environment; however, if you ascend in the 
atmosphere, as in flying in an airplane, climbing a high mountain, or riding a fast elevator, 
the atmospheric pressure, along with that in the outer ear, drops, while the pressure in the 
middle ear remains the same—greater than in the outer ear. This inequality of air pressure 
on the inside and outside of the eardrum forces the eardrum to bulge outward and potentially 
burst if the difference in pressures increases. Swallowing opens the eustachian tube so that 
air can leave the middle ear and enter the throat until the atmospheric and middle ear 
pressures are balanced. The eardrum then relaxes, and the danger of its bursting is averted. 

Inner Ear 

Sound vibrations, having been transmitted by the movement of the eardrum to the bones 
of the middle ear, reach the inner ear via the fluctuations of the oval window that separates 
the middle and inner ears. The inner ear is also called the labyrinth because of its circular, 
maze-like structure. The part of the labyrinth that leads from the oval window is a bony, 
snail shell–shaped structure called the cochlea [9]. The cochlea contains special auditory 
liquids called perilymph and endolymph through which the vibrations travel. Also present 
in the cochlea is a sensitive auditory receptor area called the organ of Corti. In the organ 
of Corti, tiny hair cells receive vibrations from the auditory liquids and relay the sound 
waves to auditory nerve fibers [10], which end in the auditory center of the cerebral cortex, 
where these impulses are interpreted and “heard.”

Study Figure 17-23, which is a schematic representation of the pathway of sound 
vibrations from the outer ear to the brain. 

The ear is an important organ of equilibrium (balance), as well as an organ for hearing. 
Refer back to Figure 17-22. The vestibule [11] connects the cochlea (for hearing) to three 
semicircular canals [12] (for balance). The semicircular canals (containing two membranous 
sacs called the saccule and utricle) contain a fluid, endolymph, as well as sensitive hair 
cells. In an intricate manner, the fluid and hair cells fluctuate in response to the movement 
of the head. This sets up impulses in nerve fibers that lead to the brain. Messages are then 
sent to muscles in all parts of the body to ensure that equilibrium is maintained.

PATHOLOGY—THE EAR 

acoustic neuroma Benign tumor arising from the acoustic vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth 
cranial nerve) in the brain. 
Initially, this tumor causes tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo (dizziness), and 
decreased hearing. Small tumors are resected by microsurgical techniques or 
ablated (removed) by radiosurgery (using powerful and precise x-ray beams rather 
than a surgical incision). 
cholesteatoma Collection of skin cells and cholesterol in a sac within the middle ear. 
These cyst-like masses produce a foul-smelling discharge and are most often 
the result of chronic otitis media. They are associated with perforations of the 
tympanic membrane (Figure 17-25B). 
deafness Loss of the ability to hear. 
Nerve deafness (sensorineural hearing loss) results from impairment of the 
cochlea or auditory (acoustic) nerve. Conductive deafness results from impairment 
of the middle ear ossicles and membranes transmitting sound waves into the 
cochlea. Hearing aids help people with conductive or sensorineural hearing loss. 
These devices have a microphone to pick up sounds, an amplifier to increase their 
volume, and a speaker to transmit amplified sounds. See Figure 17-26. 
Meniere disease Disorder of the labyrinth of the inner ear; elevated endolymph pressure 
within the cochlea (cochlear hydrops) and semicircular canals 
(vestibular hydrops). 
Signs and symptoms are tinnitus, heightened sensitivity to loud sounds, progressive 
loss of hearing, headache, nausea, and vertigo. Attacks last minutes or continue 
for hours. The cause is unknown, and treatment is bed rest, sedation, and drugs 
to combat nausea and vertigo. Surgery may be necessary to relieve accumulation 
of fluid from the inner ear. 



SENSE ORGANS: THE EYE AND THE EAR 723

otitis media Inflammation of the middle ear. 
Acute otitis media is infection of the middle ear, often following an upper 
respiratory infection (URI). Pain and fever with redness and loss of mobility of the 
tympanic membrane occur (Figure 17-25C). As bacteria invade the middle ear, pus 
formation occurs (suppurative otitis media). It is treated with antibiotics, but if 
the condition becomes chronic, myringotomy may be required to ventilate the 
middle ear. 
Serous otitis media is a noninfectious inflammation with accumulation of 
serous fluid. It often results from a dysfunctional or obstructed auditory tube. 
Treatment includes myringotomy to aspirate fluid and placement of tympanostomy 
tubes in the eardrum to allow ventilation of the middle ear (Figure 17-25D). 
otosclerosis Hardening of the bony tissue of the middle ear. 
The result of this hereditary condition is that bone forms around the oval window 
and causes fixation or ankylosis (stiffening) of the stapes bone (ossicle). Conduction 
deafness occurs, as the ossicles cannot pass on vibrations when sound enters the 
ear. Stapedectomy with replacement by a prosthesis (artificial part) is effective 
in restoring hearing (see Figure 17-24 on page 721). In order to perform this 
operation, the oval window must be fenestrated (opened) using a laser. 
tinnitus Sensation of noises (ringing, buzzing, whistling, booming) in the ears. 
Caused by irritation of delicate hair cells in the inner ear, this disease symptom 
may be associated with presbycusis, Meniere disease, otosclerosis, chronic otitis, 
labyrinthitis, and other disorders. Tinnitus can be persistent and severe and can 
interfere with the affected person’s daily life. Treatment includes biofeedback to 
help the patient relax and exert control over stress and anxiety if these are 
contributing factors. Tinnitus, a Latin-derived term, means tinkling. 
vertigo Sensation of irregular or whirling motion either of oneself or of 
external objects. 
Vertigo can result from disease in the labyrinth of the inner ear or in the nerve 
that carries messages from the semicircular canals to the brain. Equilibrium and 
balance are affected, and nausea may occur as well. 
Tinnitus 
Note the spelling! Tinnitus is a condition (-itus), not an inflammation (-itis).

CLINICAL PROCEDURES—THE EAR 

audiometry Testing the sense of hearing. 
An audiometer is an electrical device that delivers acoustic stimuli of specific 
frequencies to determine a patient’s hearing loss for each frequency (Figure 
17-26A). Results are shown on a chart or audiogram (Figure 17-26B). 
cochlear implant procedure Surgical insertion of a device that allows sensorineural hearing– 
impaired persons to understand speech. 
Electrical signals are sent directly into the auditory nerve by means of multiple 
electrodes inserted into the cochlea. An external microphone and speech processor 
pick up sound signals and convert them to electrical impulses (Figure 17-28A). 
ear thermometry Measurement of the temperature of the tympanic membrane by 
detection of infrared radiation from the eardrum. 
A device is inserted into the auditory canal, and results, which reflect the body’s 
temperature, are obtained within 2 seconds. 
otoscopy Visual examination of the ear canal with an otoscope (see Figure 17-28B). 
tuning fork test Test of ear conduction using a vibration source (tuning fork). 
To perform the Rinne test, the examiner places the base of the vibrating fork 
against the patient’s mastoid bone (bone conduction) and in front of the auditory 
meatus (air conduction). In the Weber test, the tuning fork is placed on the center 
of the forehead. The loudness of sound is equal in both ears if hearing is normal.

IN PERSON 
This first person story is written by a man with retinal detachment. 

One day, while out for my usual walk, I sneezed due to the higher pollen we 
were experiencing. It was not an easy sneeze, and I was aware of the result 
immediately. I noticed some new floaters in my left eye. No pain, but a little 
feeling that something wasn’t right. I did not see flashes of bright light (a 
good thing). 

I hoped that the floaters would minimize and when they did not, I called 
my optometrist for an appointment. My appointment was at 10:30 and by 

11:00 he had discovered a possible tear in my left retina. He walked me 
down the hall to an ophthalmologist, who confirmed the tear and suggested cryopexy, which involves numbing 
the eye, inserting a probe into the area, and freezing the tear back to the back of the eye. I was through all of 
this by 11:30. Timing is everything. 
The ophthalmologist explained that waiting 2-3 days may allow the tear to progress to a detachment which, 
if not caught, could cause more serious problems. 

If you think about a sneeze, it involves the head moving forward and stopping abruptly. As we get older, the 
clear jell (vitreous) inside the eye may pull away from the retina at the back of the eye. If this pulls away 
gradually, usually there is no problem. However, if there is a hard pull and a tear, the vitreous can pass through 
the tear lifting the retina off the back of eye, much like wallpaper can peel off a wall. There are a number of 
conditions that may lead to the chance of retinal problems such as nearsightedness, cataract surgery, glaucoma, 
family history, etc. 

As explained to me, if you are going to sneeze, grasp your head with both hands (perhaps while holding a 
tissue to your nose) to prevent the head from moving radically. That may stop the sudden front to back 
movement of your head. 

The bad news is that I couldn’t play golf for a couple of weeks after the cryopexy. My left eye looked horrible 
(itching and swollen) and I had a bunch of dark floaters in it. It was like trying to dodge 3-4 gnats right in front 
of my eyes. The good news is that my vision is intact. 

My doctor told me that once you have had one episode there is a 15% chance of developing the same 
problem in the other eye. Right on schedule, a year later, my right eye had a tear/separation. This time though, 
the separation was located on the nasal side of the eye which precluded using the cryogenic method of sealing 
the retina. My choice, in his office at least, was for a laser correction. I asked about the particulars: including 
safety, whether it would correct the problem, and how long would the procedure take. I was given assurances 
for my first two concerns, and told the procedure might take 5 minutes. I agreed to do it, but had concerns 
about how I could stay still for 5 minutes while he fired laser shots through my eye to stitch up the tear. After 
numbing the eye and putting me in the correct position, the doctor proceeded to light up my eye with 30 very 
bright flashes. He finished in 15 seconds. While I was pulling back from the head rest, I asked why had he told 
me that it would take five minutes. He said, with a little smile, that he didn’t want me to starting figuring his 
fee based on a per second basis while I was undergoing the treatment. Pretty clever, and worth the smile that 
I gave him. 

Needless to say, both eyes are fine. I still have floaters in both eyes and occasionally swipe at nonexistent 
gnats. 
It may have no relation, but my golf handicap has dropped 4 shots lower since last spring and two below my 
historical prior low. Isn’t technology great or what?

OPERATIVE REPORT 

Preoperative Diagnosis. Bilateral chronic serous otitis media; tonsilloadenoiditis. 

Operation. Bilateral myringotomies and ventilation tube insertion; T&A. 

Procedure. With the patient in the supine position and under general endotracheal anesthesia, inspection 
of AD was made under the operating microscope. The external canal was clear; tympanic membrane was 
divided. A purulent discharge appeared to be present. This drainage was suctioned out and the ear 
thoroughly lavaged [washed out]. A ventilating tube was put in place and otic drops were administered. 
Same procedure for AS. 

The patient was placed in the Rose position [supine with the head over the table edge in full extension] 
and the adenoids were removed with adenoid curettes and adenoid biopsy forceps. A nasopharyngeal 
sponge was put in place. The right tonsil was then grasped with tonsil forceps, dissected free, and removed 
with snare. Bleeding was controlled with suction cautery. The nasopharyngeal sponge was removed and 
no further bleeding noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the OR in good condition.

Circle the correct term(s) to complete each sentence. 

1. Dr. Jones specializes in pediatric ophthalmology. His examination of children with poor vision 
often leads to the diagnosis of (cataract, amblyopia, glaucoma), or lazy eye. 
2. Stella’s near vision became progressively worse as she aged. Her physician told her that she had a 
common condition called (presbyopia, detached retina, anisocoria), which often develops 
beginning in middle age. 
3. Matthew rubbed his itchy eyes constantly and thus spread his “pinkeye” or (conjunctivitis, 
blepharitis, myringitis) from one eye to the other. Dr. Chang prescribed antibiotics for this 
common condition, because Matthew had a purulent discharge suggestive of an infection. 
4. As Paul’s (mastoiditis, otitis media, tinnitus) became progressively worse, his doctor worried that 
this ringing in his ears might be caused by a benign brain tumor, a/an (cholesteatoma, acoustic 
neuroma, glaucoma). 
5. Before her second birthday, Sally had so many episodes of (vertigo, otosclerosis, suppurative otitis 
media) that Dr. Sills recommended the placement of PE tubes. 
6. Sixty-eight-year-old Bob experienced blurred vision in the central portion of his visual field. After 
careful examination of his (cornea, sclera, retina), his (ophthalmologist, optician, optometrist) 
diagnosed his condition as (glaucoma, iritis, macular degeneration). The doctor explained that the 
form of this condition was atrophic or (dry, wet), causing photoreceptor rods and cones to die. 
7. If Bob’s condition had been diagnosed as the (dry, wet) form, it might have been treated with 
(cryotherapy, intraocular lenses, laser photocoagulation) to seal leaky blood vessels. 
8. Sarah suddenly experienced bright flashes of light in her right eye. She also told her physician that 
she had a sensation of a curtain being pulled over part of the visual field in that eye. Her doctor 
examined her eye with (keratoplasty, ophthalmoscopy, tonometry) and determined that she had 
(retinal refraction, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy). Corrective surgery, known as 
(enucleation, vitrectomy, scleral buckling), was recommended. 
9. Carol awakened with a sensation of dizziness or (vertigo, tinnitus, presbycusis) as she tried to get 
out of bed. She was totally incapacitated for several days and noticed hearing loss in her left ear. 
Her physician explained that fluid called (pus, endolymph, mucus) had accumulated in her 
(auditory tube, middle ear, cochlea) and her condition was (otosclerosis, cholesteatoma, Meniere 
disease). He prescribed drugs to control her dizziness and nausea. 
10. Patients with conductive hearing loss are helped by reconstruction of the (labyrinth, tympanic 
membrane, auditory tube), a procedure known as (myringoplasty, audiometry, otoscopy). Patients 
with sensorineural hearing loss may be helped by a (hearing aid, cochlear implant, stapedectomy).

748 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 

INTRODUCTION 

The endocrine system is an information signaling system much like the nervous system. 
However, the nervous system uses nerves to conduct information, whereas the endocrine 
system uses blood vessels as information channels. Glands located in many regions of the 
body release into the bloodstream specific chemical messengers called hormones (from the 
Greek word hormōn, meaning urging on) that regulate the many and varied functions of an 
organism. For example, one hormone stimulates the growth of bones, another causes the 
maturation of sex organs and reproductive cells, and another controls the metabolic rate 
(metabolism) within all the individual cells of the body. In addition, one powerful endocrine 
gland below the brain secretes a wide variety of different hormones that travel through the 
bloodstream and regulate the activities of other endocrine glands. 

Hormones produce their effects by binding to receptors, which are recognition sites in 
the various target tissues on which the hormones act. The receptors initiate specific 
biologic effects when the hormones bind to them. Each hormone has its own receptor, and 
binding of a receptor by a hormone is much like the interaction of a key and a lock. 

Endocrine glands, no matter which hormones they produce, secrete their hormones 
directly into the bloodstream. Exocrine glands send chemical substances (tears, sweat, 
milk, saliva) via ducts to the outside of the body. Examples of exocrine glands are sweat, 
mammary, mucous, salivary, and lacrimal (tear) glands. 

The ductless, internally secreting endocrine glands are listed as follows. Locate these 
glands on Figure 18-1. 

[1] thyroid gland [5] pituitary gland 
[2] parathyroid glands (four glands) [6] ovaries in female (one pair) 
[3] adrenal glands (one pair) [7] testes in male (one pair) 
[4] pancreas (islets of Langerhans) [8] pineal gland 
The last two glands on this list, the pineal and the thymus glands, are included as 
endocrine glands because they are ductless, although little is known about their endocrine 
function in the human body. The pineal gland, located in the central portion of the brain, 
secretes melatonin. Melatonin functions to support the body’s “biological clock” and is 
thought to induce sleep. The pineal gland has been linked to a mental condition, seasonal 
affective disorder (SAD), in which the person suffers depression in winter months. 
Melatonin secretion increases with deprivation of light and is inhibited by sunlight. 
Calcification of the pineal gland can occur and can be an important radiologic landmark 
when x-rays of the brain are examined. 
Hormones are also secreted by endocrine tissue in other organs apart from the major 
endocrine glands. Examples are erythropoietin (kidney), human chorionic gonadotropin 
(placenta), and cholecystokinin (gallbladder). Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances 
that affect the body in many ways. First found in semen (produced by the prostate gland) 
but now recognized in cells throughout the body, prostaglandins (1) stimulate the 
contraction of the uterus; (2) regulate body temperature, platelet aggregation, and acid 
secretion in the stomach; and (3) have the ability to lower blood pressure. 
Endocrine tissue (apart from the major glands) is reviewed in Table 18-1. Use it as a 
reference.

FIGURE 18-2 The thyroid gland, anterior view. Notice how the thyroid gland covers the trachea like a 
shield (thyr/o = shield). 
THYROID GLAND 
LOCATION AND STRUCTURE 
Label Figure 18-2. 
The thyroid gland [1] is composed of a right and a left lobe on either side of the trachea 
[2], just below a large piece of cartilage called the thyroid cartilage [3]. The thyroid cartilage 
covers the larynx and produces the prominence on the neck known in men as the “Adam’s 
apple.” The isthmus [4] of the thyroid gland is a narrow strip of glandular tissue that 
connects the two lobes on the ventral (anterior) surface of the trachea. 
FUNCTION 
Two of the hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are thyroxine or tetraiodothyronine 
(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are synthesized in the thyroid gland from 
iodine, which is picked up from the blood circulating through the gland, and from an 
amino acid called tyrosine. T4 (containing four atoms of iodine) is much more concentrated 
in the blood, whereas T3 (containing three atoms of iodine) is far more potent in affecting 
the metabolism of cells. Most thyroid hormone is bound to protein molecules as it travels 
in the bloodstream. 
T4 and T3 are necessary in the body to maintain a normal level of metabolism in all body 
cells. Cells need oxygen to carry on metabolic processes, one aspect of which is burning 
food to release the energy stored within it. Thyroid hormone aids cells in their uptake of 
oxygen and thus supports the metabolic rate in the body. Injections of thyroid hormone 
raise the metabolic rate, whereas removal of the thyroid gland, diminishing thyroid 
hormone content in the body, results in a lower metabolic rate, heat loss, and poor physical 
and mental development.

FIGURE 18-3 The thyroid gland: its hormones and actions. 

A more recently discovered hormone produced by the thyroid gland is calcitonin. 
Calcitonin is secreted when calcium levels in the blood are high. It stimulates calcium to 
leave the blood and enter the bones, thus lowering blood calcium back to normal. Calcitonin 
contained in a nasal spray may be used for treatment of osteoporosis (loss of bone density). 
By increasing calcium storage in bone, calcitonin strengthens weakened bone tissue and 
prevents spontaneous bone fractures. Figure 18-3 summarizes the hormones secreted by 
the thyroid gland. 

PARATHYROID GLANDS

752 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

FUNCTION 
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the parathyroid glands. This hormone (also 
known as parathormone) mobilizes calcium (a mineral substance) from bones into the 
bloodstream, where calcium is necessary for proper functioning of body tissues, especially 
muscles. Normally, calcium in the food we eat is absorbed from the intestine and carried 
by the blood to the bones, where it is stored. The adjustment of the level of calcium in 
the blood is a good example of the way hormones in general control the homeostasis 
(equilibrium or constancy in the internal environment) of the body. If blood calcium 
decreases (as in pregnancy or in vitamin D deficiency), parathyroid hormone secretion 
increases, causing calcium to leave bones and enter the bloodstream. In this way, blood 
calcium levels are brought back to normal (Figure 18-5). 
ADRENAL GLANDS 
LOCATION AND STRUCTURE 
Label Figure 18-6. 
The adrenal glands are two small glands, one on top of each kidney [1]. Each gland 
consists of two parts: an outer portion, the adrenal cortex [2], and an inner portion, the 
adrenal medulla [3]. The adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla are two glands in one, secreting 
different hormones. The adrenal cortex secretes steroids or corticosteroids (complex

chemicals derived from cholesterol); the adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines 
(chemicals derived from amino acids). 

FUNCTION 

The adrenal cortex secretes three types of corticosteroids.

 1. 
Glucocorticoids—These steroid hormones have an important influence on the 
metabolism of sugars, fats, and proteins within all body cells and have a powerful anti-
inflammatory effect. 
Cortisol helps regulate glucose, fat, and protein metabolism. It raises blood glucose 
as part of a response to stress. Cortisone is a hormone very similar to cortisol and can 
be prepared synthetically. Cortisone is useful in treating inflammatory conditions 
such as rheumatoid arthritis.

 2. 
Mineralocorticoids—The major mineralocorticoid is aldosterone. It regulates the 
concentration of mineral salts (electrolytes) in the body. Aldosterone acts on the 
kidney to reabsorb sodium (an important electrolyte) and water and to excrete 
potassium (another major electrolyte). Thus, it regulates blood volume and blood 
pressure and electrolyte concentration. 
3. 
Sex hormones—Androgens (testosterone) and estrogens are secreted in small 
amounts and influence secondary sex characteristics, such as pubic and axillary hair 
in boys and girls. In females, the masculinizing effects of adrenal androgens (increased 
body hair), may appear when levels of ovarian estrogen decrease after menopause. 
Think of the “three S’s” to recall the main adrenal cortex hormones that influence sugar 
(cortisol), salt (aldosterone), and sex (androgens and estrogens). 

The adrenal medulla secretes two types of catecholamine hormones:

 1. 
Epinephrine (adrenaline)—Increases heart rate and blood pressure, dilates bronchial 
tubes, and releases glucose (sugars) from glycogen (storage substance) when the body 
needs it for more energy. 
2. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)—Constricts blood vessels to raise blood pressure. 
Both epinephrine and norepinephrine are sympathomimetic agents because they mimic, or 
copy, the actions of the sympathetic nervous system. They are released to help the body 
meet the challenges of stress in response to stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Figure 18-7 summarizes hormones secreted by the adrenal glands and their actions.

PANCREAS 
LOCATION AND STRUCTURES 
Label Figure 18-8. 
The pancreas [1] is located near and partly behind the stomach [2] in the region of 
the first and second lumbar vertebrae. The endocrine tissue of the pancreas consists of 
specialized hormone-producing cells called the islets of Langerhans [3] or islet cells. More 
than 98% of the pancreas consists of exocrine cells (glands and ducts). These cells secrete 
digestive enzymes into the gastrointestinal tract. 
FUNCTION 
The islets of Langerhans produce insulin (produced by beta cells) and glucagon (produced 
by alpha cells). Both play a role regulating blood glucose (sugar) levels. When blood glucose 
rises, insulin lowers blood sugar by helping it enter body cells. Insulin also lowers blood 
sugar by causing conversion of glucose to glycogen (a starch storage form of sugar) in 
the liver. If blood glucose levels fall too low, glucagon raises blood sugar by acting on liver 
cells to promote conversion of glycogen back to glucose. Thus, the endocrine function of 
the pancreas is another example of homeostasis, the body’s ability to regulate its inner 
environment to maintain stability.

PITUITARY GLAND 

LOCATION AND STRUCTURE 

Label Figure 18-10. 

The pituitary gland, also called the hypophysis, is a small pea-sized gland located at the 
base of the brain in a small pocket-like depression of the skull called the sella turcica. It is 
a well-protected gland, with the entire mass of the brain above it and the nasal cavity below. 
The ancient Greeks incorrectly imagined that its function was to produce pituita, or nasal 
secretion. 

The pituitary consists of two distinct parts: an anterior lobe or adenohypophysis [1], 
composed of glandular epithelial tissue, and a posterior lobe or neurohypophysis [2], 
composed of nervous tissue. The hypothalamus [3] is a region of the brain under the 
thalamus and above the pituitary gland. Signals transmitted from the hypothalamus control 
secretions by the pituitary gland. Special secretory neurons in the hypothalamus send 
releasing and inhibiting factors (hormones) via capillaries to the anterior pituitary gland.

These factors stimulate or inhibit secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary 
(Figure 18-11A). The hypothalamus also produces and secretes hormones directly to the 
posterior pituitary gland, where the hormones are stored and then released (Figure 18-11B). 
FUNCTION 
Although no bigger than a pea, the pituitary gland is often called the “master gland” 
because it makes hormones that control several other endocrine glands. 
The major hormones of the anterior pituitary gland are: 
1. Growth hormone (GH), or somatotropin (STH)—Promotes protein synthesis that 
results in the growth of bones, muscles, and other tissues. GH also stimulates the 
liver to make insulin-like growth factor, which stimulates the growth of bones. It 
increases blood glucose levels and is secreted during exercise, sleep, and hypoglycemia. 
2. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or thyrotropin—Stimulates the growth of the 
thyroid gland and secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). 
3. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or adrenocorticotropin—Stimulates the 
growth of the adrenal cortex and increases its secretion of steroid hormones (primarily 
cortisol). 
4. Gonadotropic hormones—Several gonadotropic hormones influence the growth and 
hormone secretion of the ovaries in females and the testes in males. 
In the female, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) 
stimulate the growth of eggs in the ovaries, the production of hormones, and ovulation. 
In the male, FSH influences the production of sperm, and LH (an interstitial cell– 
stimulating hormone) stimulates the testes to produce testosterone. 
5. Prolactin (PRL)—Stimulates breast development during pregnancy and sustains 
milk production after birth. 
The posterior pituitary gland stores and releases two important hormones that are 
synthesized in the hypothalamus: 
1. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin—Stimulates the reabsorption 
of water by the kidney tubules. In addition, ADH also increases blood pressure by 
constricting arterioles.

2. Oxytocin (OT)—Stimulates the uterus to contract during childbirth and maintains 
labor during childbirth. Oxytocin is also secreted during suckling and causes the 
production of milk from the mammary glands. 
Figure 18-12 summarizes hormones secreted by the pituitary gland and their functions. 
OVARIES 
LOCATION AND STRUCTURE 
The ovaries are two small glands located in the lower abdominal region of the female. The 
ovaries produce the female gamete, the ovum, as well as hormones that are responsible for 
female sex characteristics and regulation of the menstrual cycle. 
FUNCTION 
The ovarian hormones are estrogens (estradiol and estrone) and progesterone. Estrogens 
stimulate development of ova (eggs) and development of female secondary sex 
characteristics. Progesterone is responsible for the preparation and maintenance of the 
uterus in pregnancy.

LOCATION AND STRUCTURE 

The testes are two small ovoid glands suspended from the inguinal region of the male by 
the spermatic cord and surrounded by the scrotal sac. The testes produce the male gametes, 
spermatozoa, as well as the male hormone called testosterone. 

FUNCTION 

Testosterone is an androgen (male steroid hormone) that stimulates development of 
sperm and secondary sex characteristics in the male (development of beard and pubic hair, 
deepening of voice, and distribution of fat).

PATHOLOGY 

THYROID GLAND 

Enlargement of the thyroid gland is goiter (Figure 18-15A). Endemic (en-= in; dem/o = people) goiter 
occurs in certain regions where there is a lack of iodine in the diet. Goiter develops when low iodine levels lead 
to low T3 and T4 levels. This causes feedback to the hypothalamus and adenohypophysis, stimulating them to 
secrete releasing factors and TSH. TSH then promotes the thyroid gland to secrete T3 and T4, but because 
there is no iodine available, the only effect is to increase the size of the gland (goiter). Prevention includes 
increasing the supply of iodine (as iodized salt) in the diet. 

Another type of goiter is nodular or adenomatous goiter, in which hyperplasia occurs as well as formation 
of nodules and adenomas. Some patients with nodular goiter develop hyperthyroidism with clinical signs and 
symptoms such as rapid pulse, tremors, nervousness, and excessive sweating. Treatment is with thyroid-
blocking drugs or radioactive iodine to suppress thyroid functioning. 

Hypersecretion 

hyperthyroidism Overactivity of the thyroid gland; thyrotoxicosis. 

The most common form of this condition is Graves disease (resulting from 

autoimmune processes). Because metabolism is faster, the condition is marked 

by an increase in heart rate (with irregular beats), higher body temperature, 

hyperactivity, weight loss, and increased peristalsis (diarrhea occurs). In addition, 

exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs, or proptosis) occurs as a result of 

swelling of tissue behind the eyeball, pushing it forward. Treatment of Graves 

disease includes management with antithyroid drugs to reduce the amount of 

thyroid hormone produced by the gland and administration of radioactive iodine, 

which destroys the overactive glandular tissue. Figure 18-15B shows a patient 

with Graves disease. 

AB

from the Latin guttur, meaning throat. B, Exophthalmos in Graves disease. Note the staring or startled 
expression resulting from periorbital edema (swelling of tissue around the eyeball or orbit of the eye). 
Exophthalmos usually persists despite treatment of Graves disease. 



ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 767 


Hyposecretion 

hypothyroidism 

Neoplasms 

thyroid carcinoma 

PARATHYROID GLANDS 

Hypersecretion 

hyperparathyroidism 

Underactivity of the thyroid gland. 

Any of several conditions can produce hypothyroidism (thyroidectomy, thyroiditis, 
endemic goiter, destruction of the gland by irradiation), but all have similar 
physiologic effects. These include fatigue, muscular and mental sluggishness, 
weight gain, fluid retention, slow heart rate, low body temperature, and 
constipation. Two examples of hypothyroid disorders are myxedema and cretinism. 

Myxedema is advanced hypothyroidism in adulthood. Atrophy of the thyroid 
gland occurs, and practically no hormone is produced. The skin becomes dry and 
puffy (edema) because of the collection of mucus-like (myx/o = mucus) material 
under the skin. Many patients also develop atherosclerosis because lack of thyroid 
hormone increases the quantity of blood lipids (fats). Recovery may be complete if 
thyroid hormone is given soon after symptoms appear. Figure 18-16A on page 768 
shows a patient with myxedema. 

In cretinism, extreme hypothyroidism during infancy and childhood leads to a 
lack of normal physical and mental growth. Skeletal growth is more inhibited than 
soft tissue growth, so the affected person has the appearance of an obese, short, 
and stocky child. Treatment consists of administration of thyroid hormone, which 
may be able to reverse some of the hypothyroid effects. 

Cancer of the thyroid gland. 

More than half of thyroid malignancies are slow-growing papillary carcinomas 
and about one third are slow-growing follicular carcinomas. Others include 
rapidly growing anaplastic (widely metastatic) tumors. Radioactive iodine scans 
distinguish hyperfunctioning areas from hypofunctioning areas. “Hot” tumor 
areas (those collecting more radioactivity than surrounding tissues) usually 
indicate hyperthyroidism and benign growth; “cold,” nonfunctional nodules can 
be either benign or malignant. Ultimately, fine needle aspiration, surgical biopsy, 
or excision is required to make the diagnosis. Total or subtotal thyroidectomy with 
lymph node removal is indicated for most thyroid carcinomas. Postsurgical 
treatment with radioactive iodine destroys remaining tissue, and high doses of 
exogenous thyroid hormone are given to suppress TSH, in an effort to cause 
regression of residual tumor dependent on TSH. 

Excessive production of parathormone. 

Hypercalcemia occurs as calcium leaves the bones and enters the bloodstream, 
where it can produce damage to the kidneys and heart. Bones become decalcified 
with generalized loss of bone density (osteoporosis) and susceptibility to fractures 
and formation of cysts. Kidney stones can occur as a result of hypercalcemia and 
hypercalciuria. The cause is parathyroid hyperplasia or a parathyroid tumor. 
Treatment is resection of the overactive tissue. Medical therapy is another option 
for the patient who is not a surgical candidate. Bisphosphonates, such as 
alendronate (Fosamax), decrease bone turnover and decrease hypercalcemia. 

18 


768 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 


Hyposecretion 
hypoparathyroidism Deficient production of parathyroid hormone. 
Hypocalcemia results as calcium remains in bones and is unable to enter the 
bloodstream. This leads to muscle and nerve weakness with spasms of muscles, 
a condition called tetany (constant muscle contraction). Administration of 
calcium plus large quantities of vitamin D (to promote absorption of calcium) can 
control the calcium level in the bloodstream. 

ADRENAL CORTEX 

Hypersecretion 

adrenal virilism 
Excessive secretion of adrenal androgens. 

Adrenal hyperplasia or more commonly adrenal adenomas or carcinomas can 
cause virilization in adult women. Signs and symptoms include amenorrhea, 
hirsutism (excessive hair on the face and body), acne, and deepening of the voice. 
Drug therapy to suppress androgen production and adrenalectomy are possible 
treatments. 

Cushing syndrome 
Group of signs and symptoms produced by excess cortisol from the 
adrenal cortex. 

A number of signs and symptoms occur as a result of increased cortisol secretion, 
including obesity, moon-like fullness of the face, excess deposition of fat in the 
thoracic region of the back (so-called buffalo hump), hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, 
hypokalemia, osteoporosis, virilization, and hypertension. The cause may be 
excess ACTH secretion or tumor of the adrenal cortex. Tumors and disseminated 
cancers can be associated with ectopic secretion of hormone, such as ectopic 
ACTH produced by nonendocrine neoplasms (lung and thyroid tumors). Figure 
18-16B shows a woman with Cushing syndrome. See the In Person story, 
page 781, of a woman’s journey with Cushing syndrome.

Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. In Cushing disease, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland (pituitary 
adenoma) increases ACTH secretion, stimulating the adrenal cortex to produce excess cortisol. The cure for Cushing disease is 
removal of the pituitary adenoma. Dr. Harvey Cushing described the condition in 1932. 



ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 769 



FIGURE 18-17 Addison disease. Notice the darker skin discoloration, especially evident on the face. 

In clinical practice, most cases of Cushing syndrome result from chronic use of 
cortisone-like drugs, such as steroids. Examples are the cases in young athletes 
seeking to improve their performance and in patients treated for autoimmune 
disorders, asthma, kidney, and skin conditions. Steroids (prednisone is an example) 
are never discontinued abruptly because the adrenal cortex and pituitary gland 
(ACTH producer) need time to “restart” after long periods of prescribed cortisol 
use (the adrenal gland stops producing cortisol when cortisol is given as therapy). 

Hyposecretion 

Addison disease 
Hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. 

The adrenal cortex is essential to life. When aldosterone and cortisol blood levels 
are low, the patient experiences generalized malaise, weakness, muscle atrophy, 
and severe loss of fluids and electrolytes (with hypoglycemia, low blood pressure, 
and hyponatremia). An insufficient supply of cortisol signals the pituitary to 
secrete more ACTH, which increases pigmentation of scars, skin folds, and breast 
nipples (hyperpigmentation) (Figure 18-17). 

Primary insufficiency is believed to be due to autoimmune adrenalitis. Treatment 

consists of daily cortisone administration and intake of salts or administration of 

a synthetic form of aldosterone. 

ADRENAL MEDULLA 

Hypersecretion 

pheochromocytoma 
Benign tumor of the adrenal medulla; tumor cells stain a dark or dusky 
(phe/o) color (chrom/o). 

The tumor cells produce excess secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. 
Signs and symptoms are hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, severe headaches, 
sweating, flushing of the face, and muscle spasms. Surgery to remove the tumor 
and administration of antihypertensive drugs are possible treatments.

770 ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 

PANCREAS 

Hypersecretion 

hyperinsulinism 
Excess secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia. 

The cause may be a tumor of the pancreas (benign adenoma or carcinoma) or 
an overdose of insulin. Hypoglycemia occurs as insulin draws sugar out of the 
bloodstream. Fainting spells, convulsions, and loss of consciousness are common 
because a minimal level of blood sugar is necessary for proper mental functioning. 

Hyposecretion 

diabetes mellitus (DM) 
Lack of insulin secretion or resistance of insulin in promoting sugar, 
starch, and fat metabolism in cells. 

In diabetes mellitus (mellitus means sweet or sugary), insulin insufficiency or 
ineffectiveness prevents sugar from leaving the blood and entering the body cells, 
where it is used to produce energy. There are two types of diabetes mellitus. 

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies against normal 
pancreatic islet cells are present. Onset is usually in early childhood but can 
occur in adulthood, and the etiology involves destruction of the beta islet cells, 
producing complete deficiency of insulin in the body. Patients usually are thin and 
require frequent injections of insulin to maintain a normal level of glucose in the 
blood. 

 Type 1 requires patients to monitor their blood glucose levels several 
times a day using a glucometer. To test sugar levels with this device, the user 
pricks a finger to draw blood. At a minimum, patients test before each meal and 
at bedtime, but many test up to 12 times a day. Patients must continually (every 
day) balance insulin levels with food and exercise (see the In Person account on 
pages 779-780). In addition to injecting insulin into the body (buttocks, thighs, 
abdomen and arms), it is also possible to administer insulin through a portable 
pump, which infuses the drug continuously through a indwelling needle under 
the skin (Figure 18-18).
18 
FIGURE 18-18 Insulin pump. This device can be programmed to deliver doses of insulin according to 
varying body needs. Basal insulin is delivered continuously over 24 hours and mimics the normal secretion 
by the pancreas. Bolus insulin is delivered or injected at mealtimes to “cover” a specific amount of sugar or 
starch ingested. (Courtesy Ruthellen Sheldon.) 

Insulin 

There are many different types of insulin. Insulin can be rapid-acting (peak at 30 to 60 minutes and last 3 to 5 hours), 
short-acting (peak at 1. to 2 hours and last 6 to 8 hours), intermediate-acting (peak at 4 to 12 hours and last 14 to 24 
hours), or long-acting (peak at 1 to 2 hours and last up to 24 hours). The rapid and short-acting insulins are taken before a 
meal to reduce the blood sugar spike that normally occurs after eating. Intermediate- and long-acting insulins mimic the natural 
production of insulin by the pancreas. 



ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 771 

Type 2 diabetes is a separate disease from type 1. Patients often are older, and 
usually there is a family history of type 2 diabetes. Obesity is very common. The 
islet cells are not initially destroyed, and there is a relative deficiency of insulin 
secretion with a resistance by target tissues to insulin. Insulin resistance usually 
develops 5 to 10 years before type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, and is associated with 
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, high blood pressure, high 
cholesterol, and central abdominal obesity are seen in people who have insulin 
resistance. Treatment of type 2 diabetes is with diet, weight reduction, exercise, 
and, if necessary, insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Oral hypoglycemic agents 
stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas and improve the body’s 
sensitivity to insulin. 

Table 18-3 compares the clinical features, symptoms, and treatment of type 1 
and type 2 diabetes. 

Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with primary and secondary 
complications. The primary complication of type 1 is hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia 
can lead to ketoacidosis (fats are improperly burned, leading to an accumulation 
of ketones and acids in the body). Ketoacidosis can also result from illness or 
infection, and initial symptoms may be upset stomach and vomiting. Hypoglycemia 
occurs when too much insulin is taken by the patient. Insulin shock is severe 
hypoglycemia caused by an overdose of insulin, decreased intake of food, or 
excessive exercise. Signs and symptoms are sweating, hunger, confusion, trembling, 
nervousness, and numbness. Treatment of severe hypoglycemia is with either a 
shot of glucagon or intravenous glucose to restore normal blood glucose levels. 
Convulsions, coma, and loss of consciousness can result if treatment is not given.

or minimized with optimal glycemic control. 

Secondary (long-term) complications may appear many years after the patient 
develops diabetes. These include destruction of retinal blood vessels (diabetic 
retinopathy), causing visual loss and blindness; destruction of the kidneys 
(diabetic nephropathy), causing renal insufficiency and often requiring 
hemodialysis or renal transplantation; destruction of blood vessels, with 
atherosclerosis leading to stroke, heart disease, and peripherovascular ischemia 
(gangrene, infection, and loss of limbs); and destruction of nerves (diabetic 
neuropathy) involving pain or loss of sensation, most commonly in the extremities. 
Loss of gastric motility (gastroparesis) also occurs. Figure 18-19 reviews the 
secondary complications of diabetes mellitus. 

As a result of hormonal changes during pregnancy, gestational diabetes can 
occur in women with a predisposition to diabetes during the second or third 
trimester of pregnancy. After delivery, blood glucose usually returns to normal. 
Type 2 diabetes may develop in these women later in life.

PITUITARY GLAND: ANTERIOR LOBE 


Hypersecretion 
acromegaly Hypersecretion of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary after 
puberty, leading to enlargement of extremities. 
An excess of growth hormone (GH) is produced by adenomas of the pituitary gland 
that occur during adulthood. This excess GH stimulates the liver to secrete a 
hormone (somatomedin C, or insulin-like growth factor [IGF]) that causes the 
clinical manifestations of acromegaly (acr/o in this term means extremities). 
Bones in the hands, feet, face, and jaw grow abnormally large, producing a 
characteristic “Frankenstein”-type facial appearance. The pituitary adenoma can 
be irradiated or surgically removed. Figure 18-20 shows the features of a woman 
with acromegaly. Measurement of blood levels of somatomedin C as GH fluctuates 
is a test for acromegaly.

gigantism Hypersecretion of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary before 
puberty, leading to abnormal overgrowth of body tissues. 
Benign adenomas of the pituitary gland that occur before a child reaches puberty 
produce an excess of growth hormone. See Figure 18-21. Gigantism can be 
corrected by early diagnosis in childhood, followed by resection of the tumor or 
irradiation of the pituitary. 
Hyposecretion 
dwarfism Congenital hyposecretion of growth hormone; hypopituitary dwarfism. 
Children who are affected are normal mentally, but their bones remain small. 
Treatment consists of administration of growth hormone. Achondroplastic dwarfs 
differ from hypopituitary dwarfs in that they have a genetic defect in cartilage 
formation that limits the growth of long bones. 
panhypopituitarism Deficiency of all pituitary hormones. 
Tumors of the sella turcica as well as arterial aneurysms may be etiologic factors, 
causing a failure of the pituitary to secrete hormones that stimulate major glands 
in the body. 



ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 775 


PITUITARY GLAND: POSTERIOR LOBE 


Hypersecretion 
syndrome of inappropriate Excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone. 
ADH (SIADH) Hypersecretion of ADH produces excess water retention in the body. Treatment 
consists of dietary water restriction. Tumor, drug reactions, and head injury are 
some of the possible causes. 
Hyposecretion 
diabetes insipidus (DI) Insufficient secretion of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). 
Deficiency of antidiuretic hormone causes the kidney tubules to fail to hold back 
(reabsorb) needed water and salts. Clinical manifestations include polyuria and 
polydipsia. Synthetic preparations of ADH are administered with nasal sprays or 
intramuscularly as treatment. Insipidus means tasteless, reflecting the condition 
of dilute urine, as opposed to mellitus, meaning sweet or like honey, reflecting the 
sugar content of urine in diabetes mellitus. The term diabetes comes from the 
Greek diabainein, meaning to pass through. Both diabetes insipidus and diabetes 
mellitus are characterized by polyuria.

LABORATORY TESTS 


fasting plasma glucose Also known as fasting blood sugar test. Measures circulating glucose 
(FPG) level in a patient who has fasted at least 8 hours. 
This test can diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes (blood glucose is higher 
than normal but not high enough for diagnosis of diabetes). A normal result is 
99 mg/dL or lower. Pre-diabetes levels are 100 to 125 mg/dL and diabetes is 
126 mg/dL and above. A casual non-fasting plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL plus 
the presence of signs and symptoms such as increased urination, increased thirst, 
and unexplained weight loss can also diagnose diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance 
test is used to diagnose pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes. 
The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test (A1c for short), by measuring the 
percentage of red blood cells with glucose attached, monitors long-term glucose 
control. A high level indicates poor glucose control in diabetic patients. 
serum and urine tests Measurement of hormones, electrolytes, glucose, and other substances 
in serum (blood) and urine as indicators of endocrine function. 
Serum studies include growth hormone, somatomedin C (insulin-like growth 
factor), prolactin level, gonadotropin levels, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and 
cortisol. A high reading on blood glucose testing by glucometer in a doctor’s office 
may be the first indication of a diabetes diagnosis (levels may be as high as 
750 mg/dL, whereas normal is about 100 mg/dL). 
Urine studies include dipstick testing for glucose (Clinistix, Labstix) and 
ketones (Acetest, Ketostix), and measurement of 17-ketosteroids (to check adrenal 
and gonadal function). A urinary microalbumin assay may detect small quantities 
of albumin in urine as a marker or harbinger of diabetic nephropathy. 
thyroid function tests Measurement of T3, T4, and TSH in the bloodstream. 

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

exophthalmometry 
Measurement of eyeball protrusion (as in Graves disease) with an 
exophthalmometer. 

computed tomography (CT) X-ray imaging of endocrine glands in cross section and other views, to 
scan assess size and infiltration by tumor. 

magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic waves produce images of the hypothalamus and pituitary 
(MRI) gland to locate abnormalities. 

thyroid scan 
Scanner detects radioactivity and visualizes the thyroid gland. 

Administration of radioactivity is either intravenous (with radioactive technetium) 
or oral (with radioactive iodine). The latter is called RAIU (radioactive iodine 
uptake scan). Thyroid function is assessed; nodules and tumors can be evaluated. 

ultrasound examination 
Sound waves show images of endocrine organs. 

Thyroid ultrasound is the best method to evaluate thyroid structures and 
abnormalities (nodules).

IN PERSON 
This first-person account was written by the mother of a 12-yearold 
boy who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8. 

On school days, I wake up Jake at 6:30 AM. He tests his blood sugar by 
pricking his finger until it bleeds and sticking a test strip into the 
drop of blood. Then he inserts the strip into a small handheld 
glucometer and waits 3 to 5 seconds for a reading of his blood sugar. 
If this is 120 mg/dL or higher, he gives himself insulin 10 to 15 
minutes before breakfast. I calculate how many carbohydrates (by 
reading labels and measuring food quantities precisely) he will have 
in his breakfast so that he can bolus [give himself enough insulin to 
cover the food he will eat] correctly. He has an insulin pump, so he 
types in the amount of carbohydrates he will eat plus his current 
blood sugar reading. The pump calculates how much insulin he needs 
to cover the carbs and any extra insulin he may need to bring down a 
high blood sugar. After he boluses he waits 15 minutes to eat breakfast. 
If his blood sugar is less than 120 mg/dL he will not bolus until he 
starts eating, because if the insulin acts too rapidly his blood sugar 
can drop too low. 

As I cook his breakfast, I count carbs exactly—3 eggs (he needs 
protein to keep his blood sugar stable throughout the morning), 15 carbs of fruit (15 grapes, . banana, 
. small apple, or 1. clementines), one 8-oz cup of low-carb juice, and 3 waffles. If his blood sugar is low, he 
will eat. 

I then count carbs for his lunch and place an index card in his lunch bag to show the nurse before his 
lunchtime bolus. At school, he visits the nurse if he feels high or low, and at lunch as well. . . I worry about his 
exposure to all the sick kids at school when he visits the nurse. At school, if his blood sugar is high, he drinks 
water and tests his urine for ketones to make sure he does not have ketonuria, which may indicate ketoacidosis. 
If it is positive for ketones, he is sent home from school (fortunately, this has never happened). 

At lunch, he leaves class early to test his blood sugar and does the same calculations as at breakfast. He waits 
for the nurse to manually compute the amount of insulin he needs to make sure that it matches the calculation 
of the pump. Then he boluses and goes to lunch. If his blood sugar is less than 70, he can’t go to lunch with 
his friends. He eats or drinks some fast-acting sugar (Skittles, Smarties, or Sprite) and waits for his blood 
sugar to rise to an acceptable range. 

We plan ahead for all field trips and food snacks that are brought into the classroom. If Jake is playing 
sports, he times his meals with the start of the activity so his blood sugar is around 150. He disconnects his 
pump during sports. Jake is an avid soccer player. At halftime he tests his blood sugar. If it is low, he needs to 
eat. If it is high, he needs to reconnect his pump and get more insulin. After sports, his blood sugar usually 
spikes because of an adrenaline [epinephrine] rush and then crashes down 3 to 10 hours later. This is 
unpredictable and never consistent, so it takes guesswork to keep him in range after a sports game or practice. 

During the night, his dad and I set alarms to wake up every few hours to test him. If his blood sugar is high 
while he sleeps, we use his pump to give him a correction. If it is low, we wake him and have him drink Sprite 
or eat Smarties. Sometimes we check him four or five times during the night. Even if his numbers are stable, 
it’s not a guarantee that he won’t drop suddenly and have a seizure (this happened once after we had tested 
him at 11 PM and 2 AM and he was steady). He never complains about all the interruptions to his sleep and does 
a great job of falling right back to sleep when awakened.

Every 2 days he changes his insertion site for the insulin pump. He can’t do this alone. The pump is 
connected to his body with a small cannula [tube]. It is inserted manually via a needle into his hip region. The 
needle is then removed and the tiny Teflon cannula remains in his body, delivering fast-acting insulin under 
the skin. Plastic tubing clips into the cannula and then attaches to the side of his pump. He clips his pump to 
his waist or places it in his pocket. When he bathes, he disconnects from his pump, and when he sleeps, he 
places it on the mattress next to his body. 

His body naturally rejects the Teflon cannula, so after 2 days his pump site must be changed. We realize this 
because his blood sugar numbers start rising for no apparent reason. Typically, we will change out the pump 
site and notice that it is red and sometimes the cannula tip is bent. Although changing the pump site is time-
consuming and expensive, a bad site means that not enough insulin is getting into his body, which can quickly 
spiral into stomach pains, ketonuria, and ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Jake has just started to wear a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). This has a small sensor that 
is inserted into his arm to measure blood sugar in his interstitial fluid every minute. It is new technology that 
will actually beep at night if his blood sugar is dropping. Jake doesn’t like the system because it is painful to 
insert and is cumbersome to carry. Plus, it doesn’t replace fingersticks for blood sugar readings. It is also 
difficult to calibrate his CGMS, so the readings are not 100% reliable. This is still very new technology; we are 
very hopeful that future generations will be more reliable! 

In general, Jake’s diabetes doesn’t disrupt his life other than the nighttime checks, wearing an insulin 
pump, and paying attention to how many carbs he eats. We encourage 
him to make good nutritional choices (not always easy for a kid) and to 
limit certain foods (doughnuts, Slurpees, candy) for special occasions. 
He must also carry a glucometer with him at all times and a sugar to 
take when his blood glucose is low. 

Having a child with diabetes forces me to carefully plan the 
preparation and timing of meals. I always have certain foods and 
medical supplies in the house and I carry snacks and sugar sources 
wherever I go. I am always available to Jake and to the school nurse. I 
don’t always have a good night’s sleep. I think I would sleep better if I 
were not so driven to keep his blood sugar in a healthy range. Right 
now, my body has adjusted to this new sleep pattern and I’m happy to 
wake up for him. I try to be at all his sports events to help him manage 
his blood sugars properly before, during, and after games. He can’t go 
to a friend’s house for a sleepover and he cannot attend overnight 
camp. His dad or I must always be in town. Keeping Jake’s blood sugar 
in tight control hopefully means that he will avoid many of the 
complications frequently encountered later in life by people with type 
1 diabetes.

IN PERSON 
This first-person story is about a young woman’s experience with Cushing 
syndrome. 

I’ve always been a bit of a skinny-mini and had no major health issues. But in 
1997 I started having irregular periods. Not only were they irregular, I gained 6 
to 9 pounds every month. I knew something was wrong. 

This began my year-long journey with Cushing syndrome. Initially, I saw two 
general practitioners, had blood work done, and was told I was fine. As I gained 
more weight, Cushing’s symptoms became more apparent. I developed striae— 
purplish marks on my thighs,* a big round moon face, and a hump back.. I also 
became extremely fatigued when performing simple tasks. At the time, however, 
I had no idea or clue of what was happening. 

Next, I saw my gynecologist. Again more blood work and I was told I’m fine. 
This process continued on with three other doctors. I pressed on from feeling 
misunderstood, depressed, and utterly tired and found an endocrinologist. After 
3 months of testing, he located the problem: a tumor on my right adrenal gland. 
A month later I had a right adrenalectomy. Thankfully, my left adrenal works 
great, and I don’t have to take any hormone pills. I was also thrilled that the 72 pounds I gained over the year 
melted away in a few months. 

I’ll never forget this experience. Having an unknown medical condition is very stressful. But, in some ways, 
I was even more stressed and depressed because my doctors seemed to dismiss my symptoms. I didn’t own a 
computer at the time and I remember calling up a friend and asking her to do some research for me. I really 
felt I had to educate myself. I still don’t know what caused the adrenal gland tumor or how I could have 
prevented it. But, I am better and my Cushing’s journey taught me to be a better advocate for myself.

1. Phyllis was diagnosed with Graves disease when her husband noticed her (panhypopituitarism, 
hirsutism, exophthalmos). Her eyes seemed to be bulging out of their sockets. 
2. Helen had a primary brain tumor called a (pituitary, thyroid, adrenal) adenoma. Her entire 
endocrine system was disrupted, and her physician recommended surgery and radiation therapy to 
help relieve her symptoms. 
3. Bessie’s facial features gradually became “rough” in her late thirties and forties. By the time she was 
50, her children noticed her very large hands and recommended that she see an endocrinologist, 
who diagnosed her chronically progressive condition as (hyperinsulism, gigantism, acromegaly). 
4. Bobby was brought into the emergency department because he was found passed out in the kitchen. 
He had forgotten his insulin and had developed (Cushing disease, hyperparathyroidism, diabetic 
ketoacidosis). 
5. Because her 1-hour test of blood sugar was slightly abnormal, Selma’s obstetrician ordered a 
(glucose tolerance test, thyroid function test, Pap smear) to rule out gestational (hyperthyroidism, 
chlamydial infection, diabetes). 
6. Bill noticed that he was passing his urine more frequently, a condition known as (polyphagia, 
polyuria, hyperglycemia), and was experiencing increased thirst, manifested as (polydipsia, 
hypernatremia, polyphagia). His wife urged him to see a physician, who performed a (serum 
calcium test, urinalysis, serum sodium test) that revealed inappropriately dilute (blood, sweat, 
urine). Measurement of the hormone (PTH, ADH, STH) in his blood showed low levels. His 
diagnosis was (DI, DM, SIADH). Treatment with (oxytocin, cortisol, vasopressin) was prescribed 
via nasal spray, and his condition improved. 
7. Mary noticed that she had gained weight recently and that her face had a moon-like fullness 
with new heavy hair growth. Blood and urine tests showed excessive secretion of adrenal 
(mineralocorticoids, catecholamines, glucocorticoids). Her diagnostic work-up included a/an (CT 
scan of the abdomen, MRI study of the head, chest x-ray), which revealed enlargement of both 
(kidneys, adrenal glands, lobes of the brain). Her doctor made the diagnosis of (Graves disease, 
Cushing syndrome, Addison disease). 
8. Jack had several fractures of ribs and vertebrae in a skiing accident. X-ray images of his bones 
revealed a generalized decrease in bone density, a condition known as (osteoporosis, tetany, 
acromegaly). A blood test showed high serum (sodium, calcium, growth hormone) and high levels 
of (mineralocorticoids, somatotropin, parathyroid hormone). An ultrasound scan of the neck 
revealed a (thymus, parathyroid, thyroid) adenoma, which was removed surgically, and he 
recovered fully. His bone disease and other abnormalities were all related to (hypoparathyroidism, 
hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism).

798 CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 


INTRODUCTION 

Cancer is a disease caused by abnormal and excessive growth of cells in the body. It may 
occur in any tissue and at any time of life, although cancer occurs most frequently in older 
people. Cancer cells accumulate as growths called malignant tumors that compress, invade, 
and ultimately destroy the surrounding normal tissue. In addition to their local growth, 
cancerous cells spread throughout the body by way of the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels. 
In some patients the spread of cancers from their site of origin to distant organs occurs 
early in the course of tumor growth and ultimately results in death. 

Although more than half of all patients who develop cancer are cured of their disease, 
about 550,000 people die of cancer each year. Lung cancers, followed by breast and colorectal 
cancers, are the most common causes of cancer death for women, whereas lung, colorectal, 
and prostate cancers are the leading causes of death due to cancer in men. This chapter 
explores the terminology related to this common and often fatal group of diseases. 

CHARACTERISTICS OF TUMORS 

Tumors (neoplasms) are new growths that arise from normal tissue. They may be either 
malignant (capable of invasion and spread to surrounding or more distant sites) or benign 
(noninvasive and not spreading to other sites). There are several differences between benign 
and malignant tumors. Some of these differences are:

 1. Benign tumors grow slowly, and malignant tumor cells multiply rapidly. 
2. Benign tumors are often encapsulated (contained within a fibrous capsule or cover), 
so that the tumor cells do not invade the surrounding tissue. Malignant tumors 
characteristically are invasive and infiltrative, extending into neighboring normal 
tissue. 
3. Benign tumors are composed of organized and specialized (differentiated) cells that 
closely resemble the normal, mature tissue from which they are derived. For example,

threadlike shape of the cells. There are many nuclei per cell and many cross striations. B, Anaplastic tumor cells of the skeletal 
muscle (rhabdomyosarcoma). Note the variation in size and shape of the nuclei (pleomorphism; pleo = many, morph/o = shape), 
hyperchromatic (intensely staining) nuclei, and large tumor cells (which may possess more than one nucleus). (B, courtesy Trace 
Worrell, MD, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas.) 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 799 



FIGURE 19-2 A liver studded with 
metastatic cancer. 

benign tumors derived from epithelial cells that line the wall of the gastrointestinal 
tract look very much like their normal counterparts. Malignant tumors are composed 
of cancerous cells that resemble primitive cells and lack the capacity to perform 
mature cell functions. This characteristic of malignant tumors is called anaplasia. 
Anaplasia (ana- means backward and -plasia means growth) indicates that the 
cancerous cells are dedifferentiated, or undifferentiated (reverting to a less specialized 
state), in contrast with the normal, differentiated tissue of their origin. Anaplastic 
cells lack an orderly arrangement. Thus, tumor cells vary in size and shape and are 
piled one on top of the other in a disorganized fashion. The nuclei in these cells are 
large and hyperchromatic (stain excessively with dyes that recognize genetic material, 
DNA). Figure 19-1A and B shows normal skeletal muscle and anaplastic malignant 
muscle tumor cells. 

4. Cells from benign tumors do not spread or metastasize to form secondary tumor 
masses in distant places in the body. Cells from malignant tumors, however, can 
detach themselves from the primary tumor site, penetrate a blood vessel or lymphatic 
vessel, travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and establish a new 
tumor site at a distant tissue, such as the lung, liver, or bone marrow. The secondary 
growth is called a metastasis. Figure 19-2 shows metastatic tumors within the 
liver. 
Figure 19-3 reviews the differences between benign and malignant tumors.

CARCINOGENESIS 
WHAT CAUSES CANCER? 
The causes of transformation from a normal cell to a cancerous one (carcinogenesis) are 
only partly understood. What is clear is that malignant transformation results from damage 
to the genetic material, or DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), of the cell. Strands of DNA in the 
cell nucleus form chromosomes, which become readily visible under a microscope when a 
cell is preparing to divide into two (daughter) cells. In order to understand what causes 
cancer, it is necessary to learn more about DNA and its functions in a normal cell. 
DNA has two main functions in a normal cell. First, DNA controls the production of new 
cells (cell division). When a cell divides, the DNA material in each chromosome copies itself 
so that exactly the same DNA is passed to the two new daughter cells that are formed. This 
process of cell division is called mitosis (Figure 19-4A). 
Second, DNA contains the master code for all proteins produced in the cell. Between 
cycles of mitosis, DNA controls the production of new proteins (protein synthesis) in the 
cell. DNA contains about 20,000 to 30,000 separate and distinct genes that direct the 
production of all proteins, which in turn control all aspects of cell function. Genes are 
composed of an arrangement of units called nucleotides (containing a sugar, phosphate, 
and a base, such as adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine). DNA (as a string of coded 
nucleotides) sends a molecular message outside the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell, 
directing the synthesis of specific proteins (such as hormones and enzymes) essential for 
normal cell function and growth. This message is transmitted in the following way. In the 
nucleus, the coded message with instructions for making a specific protein is copied from 
DNA onto another molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid). Then RNA travels from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell, carrying the coded message that directs the formation 
of specific proteins (Figure 19-4B).

CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 801 


When a cell becomes malignant, however, the processes of mitosis and protein synthesis 
are disturbed. Cancer cells reproduce almost continuously, and abnormal proteins are 
made. Malignant cells are anaplastic; that is, their DNA stops making codes that allow the 
cells to carry on the function of mature cells. Instead, altered DNA and altered cellular 
programs make new signals that lead to cell proliferation, movement of cells, invasion of 
adjacent tissue, and metastasis. 

Various kinds of damage to DNA results in malignancy; DNA damage may be caused by 
environmental factors, such as toxic chemicals, sunlight, tobacco smoke, and viruses. The 
specific damage usually involves chemical changes in the nucleotide components of DNA. 
These changes interfere with the accurate coding for new protein synthesis. Once these 
changes are established in a cell, they are passed on to daughter cells. Such an inheritable 
change in DNA is called a mutation. Mutations, particularly those that stimulate cell growth 
or block DNA repair, lead to formation of malignant tumors. 

Although most DNA changes, or mutations, lead to higher-than-normal rates of growth, 
some mutations found in cancer cells actually prevent the cells from dying. In recent years, 
scientists have recognized that in some types of cancers, the normal blueprints that direct 
aging or damaged cells to die are missing. Normal cells undergo spontaneous disintegration 
by a process known as apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Some cancer cells have lost 
elements of this program and thus can live indefinitely. 

ENVIRONMENTAL AGENTS 

Agents from the environment, such as chemicals, drugs, tobacco smoke, radiation, and 
viruses, can cause damage to DNA and thus produce cancer. These environmental agents 
are called carcinogens. 

Chemical carcinogens are found in a variety of products and drugs, including 
hydrocarbons—in cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoke and automobile exhaust—insecticides, 
dyes, industrial chemicals, insulation, and hormones. For example, the hormone 
diethylstilbestrol (DES) causes a malignant tumor, carcinoma of the vagina, in daughters 
of women treated with DES during pregnancy. Drugs such as estrogens can cause cancer 
by stimulating the proliferation of cells in target organs such as the lining of the uterus. 

Radiation, whatever its source—sunlight, x-rays, radioactive substances—consists of 
waves of energy. When this energy interacts with DNA, it causes DNA damage and mutations 
that lead to cancer. Thus, leukemia (a cancerous condition of white blood cells) may be an 
occupational hazard of radiologists, who are routinely exposed to x-rays. There is a high 
incidence of leukemia and other cancers among survivors of atomic bomb explosions, as at 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Ultraviolet radiation in sunlight can cause skin cancer, especially 
in persons with lightly pigmented, or fair, skin. 

Some viruses are carcinogenic. For example, the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) 
causes a form of leukemia in adults. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by another virus, herpesvirus 
type 8. Other viruses are known to cause cervical cancer (papillomavirus) and a tumor 
of lymph nodes called Burkitt lymphoma (Epstein-Barr virus). These tumor-producing 
viruses, called oncogenic viruses, fall into two categories: RNA viruses (composed of RNA 
and known as retroviruses) and DNA viruses (composed of DNA). 

In addition to transmission of cancer by whole viruses, pieces of normal DNA called 
oncogenes can cause normal cells to become malignant if they are activated by mutations. 
An oncogene (cancer-causing gene) is a piece of DNA whose activation is associated with 
the conversion of a normal cell into a cancerous cell. Some examples of oncogenes are ras 
(colon cancer), myc (lymphoma), and abl (chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML]). 

In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the oncogene abl is activated when pieces from 
two different chromosomes switch locations. This genetic change (mutation) is called a 
translocation. The oncogene abl on chromosome 9 moves to a new location on the base of

the leukocyte divide and causes a malignancy (chronic myelogenous leukemia). The new 
chromosome formed from the translocation and containing the bcr-abl gene fragments 
is called the Philadelphia chromosome (it was discovered in 1970 in Philadelphia) 
(Figure 19-5).

HEREDITY 

Cancer may be caused by not only environmental factors but also inherited factors. 
Susceptibility to some forms of cancer is transmitted from parents to offspring through 
defects in the DNA of the egg or sperm cells. Examples of known inherited cancers are 
retinoblastoma (tumor of the retina of the eye), adenomatous polyposis coli syndrome 
(premalignant polyps that grow in the colon and rectum), and certain other inherited forms 
of colon, breast, and kidney cancer. 

Each of these diseases is caused by loss of a segment of DNA or by a change in the coding 
sequence of DNA. Detection of these changes in the DNA code is possible by analysis of 
genes on the chromosomes from any cell, such as a blood cell, taken from an affected 
individual. Such inherited defects are detected by DNA sequencing, a step-by-step analysis 
of the nucleotide sequence of the affected gene, or by small DNA probes that test the overall 
fit of a person’s gene to a normal gene sequence. 

In many cases, it is believed that these tumors arise because of inherited or acquired 
abnormalities in certain genes called suppressor genes. In normal persons, these suppressor 
genes regulate growth, promote differentiation, and suppress oncogenes from causing 
cancer. Loss of a normal suppressor gene takes the brake off the process of cell division and 
leads to cancer. Examples of suppressor genes are the retinoblastoma (Rb) type 1 gene 
(RB1) and the TP53 (p53 is the protein it encodes). A loss or mutation of TP53 (located 
on chromosome 17) can lead to human cancers, such as brain tumors or breast cancer. 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 803 
19 
Because inherited changes can be detected by analyzing DNA in any tissue of the body, 
not simply cancerous cells, blood cells from family members may be tested to determine 
whether a person has inherited the cancer-causing gene. This is known as genetic screening. 
Affected patients may be watched carefully to detect tumors at an early stage. Table 19-1 
lists several hereditary cancers and the name of the responsible gene. Figure 19-6 reviews 
the role of environmental agents and heredity in carcinogenesis. 
CLASSIFICATION OF CANCEROUS TUMORS 
Almost half of all cancer deaths are caused by malignancies that originate in lung, breast, 
or colon; however, in all there are more than 100 distinct types of cancer, each having a 
unique set of symptoms and requiring a specific type of therapy. It is possible to divide these 
types of cancer into three broad groups on the basis of histogenesis—that is, by identifying 
the particular type of tissue (hist/o) from which the tumor cells arise (-genesis). These 
major groups are carcinomas, sarcomas, and mixed-tissue tumors.

CARCINOMAS 

Carcinomas, the largest group, are solid tumors that are derived from epithelial tissue that 
lines external and internal body surfaces, including skin, glands, and digestive, urinary, and 
reproductive organs. Approximately 90% of all malignancies are carcinomas. 

Table 19-2 gives examples of specific carcinomas and the epithelial tissue from which 
they derive. Benign tumors of epithelial origin are usually designated by the term adenoma, 
which indicates that the tumor is of epithelial or glandular (aden/o) origin. For example, a 
gastric adenoma is a benign tumor of the glandular epithelial cells lining the stomach. 
Malignant tumors of epithelial origin are named by using the term carcinoma and adding 
the type of tissue in which the tumor occurs. Thus, a gastric adenocarcinoma is a cancerous 
tumor arising from glandular cells lining the stomach.

CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 805 


SARCOMAS 

Sarcomas also are malignant tumors but are less common than carcinomas. They derive 
from connective tissues in the body, such as bone, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone marrow 
and from cells of the lymphatic system. Often, the term mesenchymal tissue is used to 
describe embryonic connective tissue from which sarcomas are derived. The middle, or 
mesodermal, layer of the embryo gives rise to the connective tissues of the body as well as 
to blood and lymphatic vessels. 

Table 19-3 gives examples of specific types of sarcomas and the connective tissues from 
which they derive. Benign tumors of connective tissue origin are named by adding the 
suffix -oma to the type of tissue in which the tumor occurs. For example, a benign tumor 
of bone is called an osteoma. Malignant tumors of connective tissue origin are frequently 
named using the term sarcoma (sarc/o = flesh). For example, an osteosarcoma is a 
malignant tumor of bone.

In addition to the solid tumors of connective tissue origin, sarcomas include tumors 
arising from blood-forming tissue. Leukemias are tumors derived from bone marrow, and 
lymphomas are derived from immune cells of the lymphatic system. Cells within the brain 
(glial cells) and embryonic tissue of the nervous system give rise to gliomas (such as 
astrocytomas of the brain) and neuroblastomas, respectively. 

MIXED-TISSUE TUMORS 

Mixed-tissue tumors are derived from tissue that is capable of differentiating into both 
epithelial and connective tissue. These uncommon tumors are thus composed of several 
different types of cells. Examples of mixed-tissue tumors (Table 19-4) are found in the 
kidney, ovaries, and testes. 

PATHOLOGIC DESCRIPTIONS 

The following terms are used to describe the appearance of a malignant tumor, on either gross (visual) or 
microscopic examination. 

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS 
cystic Forming large open spaces filled with fluid. Mucinous tumors are filled 
with mucus (thick, sticky fluid), and serous tumors are filled with a thin, 
watery fluid resembling serum. The most common site of cystic tumors is 
in ovaries (Figure 19-7A).

carcinoma of the thyroid. Tumor shows a solid pattern of growth. (A, Courtesy Dr. Annekathryn Goodman, Massachusetts General 
Hospital, Boston) 




CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 807 


fungating Mushrooming pattern of growth in which tumor cells pile one on top of 
another and project from a tissue surface. Tumors found in the colon are 
often of this type. 
inflammatory Having the features of inflammation—that is, redness, swelling, and 
heat. Inflammatory changes result from tumor blockage of the lymphatic 
drainage of the skin, as in breast cancer. 
medullary Large, soft, fleshy tumors. Thyroid and breast tumors may be medullary 
(Figure 19-7B). 
necrotic Containing dead tissue. Any type of tumor can outgrow its blood supply 
with resulting cell death and necrosis of part or all of the tumor. 
polypoid Growths that form projections extending outward from a base. Sessile 
polypoid tumors extend from a broad base, and pedunculated polypoid 
tumors extend from a stem or stalk. Both benign and malignant tumors 
of the colon may grow as polyps. Benign polyps of the colon have a 
significant risk of becoming malignant over time and should be removed 
to prevent cancer (Figure 19-8A). 
ulcerating Characterized by an open, exposed surface resulting from the death of 
overlying tissue. Ulcerating tumors often are found in the stomach, 
breast, colon, and skin (Figure 19-8B). 
verrucous Resembling a wart-like growth. Tumors of the gingiva (gum) frequently 
are verrucous. 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTIONS 

alveolar 
Tumor cells form patterns resembling small sacs; commonly found in 
tumors of muscle, bone, fat, and cartilage. 

carcinoma in situ 
Referring to localized tumor cells that have not invaded adjacent 
structures. (Latin in situ means in place.) Cancer of the cervix may begin 
as carcinoma in situ.

diffuse Spreading evenly throughout the affected tissue. Malignant lymphomas 
may display diffuse involvement of lymph nodes. 
dysplastic Containing abnormal-appearing cells that are not clearly cancerous. 
Dysplastic nevi (moles on skin) are an example. They are often 
forerunners of skin cancers. 
epidermoid Resembling squamous epithelial cells (thin, plate-like); often occurring 
in the respiratory tract. 
follicular Forming small glandular sacs. Thyroid gland cancer and lymphomas are 
examples (Figure 19-9A). 
papillary Forming small, finger-like or nipple-like projections of cells. Bladder and 
thyroid cancers are examples (Figure 19-9B). 
pleomorphic Composed of a variety of types of cells. Mixed-cell tumors are examples. 
scirrhous Densely packed (scirrhous means hard) tumors, due to dense bands of 
fibrous tissue; commonly found in breast or stomach cancers. 
undifferentiated Lacking microscopic structures typical of normal mature cells. 
GRADING AND STAGING SYSTEMS 
Tumors are classified on the basis of tissue of origin, microscopic appearance, and extent 
of spread. Of particular importance are the tumor’s grade (its degree of maturity or 
differentiation under the microscope) and its stage (its extent of spread within the body). 
These two properties influence the prognosis (the chances of successful treatment and 
survival) and determine the specific treatment to be used. 
When grading a tumor, the pathologist is concerned with the microscopic appearance of 
the tumor cells, specifically with their degree of maturation or differentiation. Often, three 
or four grades are used. Grade I tumors are very well differentiated, so that they closely 
resemble cells from the normal parent tissue of their origin. Grade IV tumors are so 
undifferentiated or anaplastic that even recognition of the tumor’s tissue of origin may 
be difficult. Grades II and III are intermediate in appearance, moderately or poorly 
differentiated, as opposed to well differentiated (grade I) and undifferentiated (grade IV). 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 809 


Grading is often of value in determining the prognosis of certain types of cancers, such 
as cancer of the urinary bladder, prostate gland and ovary, and brain tumors (astrocytomas). 
Patients with grade I tumors have a high survival rate, and patients with grade II, III, and 
IV tumors have an increasingly poorer survival rate. Grading is also used in evaluating cells 
obtained from body fluids in preventive screening tests, such as Papanicolaou (Pap) smears 
of the uterine cervix. 

The staging of cancerous tumors is based on the extent of spread of the tumor. It relies 
on careful definition of the size and spread of the tumor, using CT, PET/CT, and MRI scans 
and radionuclide (radioactive) bone scans. See Figure 19-15, page 826, for a PET/CT scan 
showing lymph node metastases. An example of a staging system is the tumor-nodemetastasis 
(TNM) International Staging System. It has been applied to malignancies such 
as lung cancer, as well as to many other tumors. In this staging system, T specifies the size 
and degree of local extension of the tumor; N is the number of regional lymph nodes that 
have been invaded by tumor; and M specifies the presence or absence of metastases (spreads 
to distant sites) of the tumor cells. Numbers denote size and degree of involvement: For 
example, 0 indicates undetectable, and 1, 2, 3, and 4, a progressive increase in size or 
involvement. TNM staging may be based on clinical data (physical examination and 
radiologic assessment) or actual histopathologic evaluation of the tumor and adjacent 
lymph nodes. In some cases, bone marrow, liver, or other tissues are biopsied to confirm 
metastases. Table 19-5 presents the TNM staging system for non–small cell lung cancer. 
Once the T, N, and M categories have been assigned, then this information is combined to 
give an overall stage grouping of I, II, III, or IV.

CANCER TREATMENT 

Four major approaches to cancer treatment are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biological 
therapy. Each method (modality) may be used alone, but often they are used together in combined-modality 
regimens to improve the overall diagnosis and treatment result. 

SURGERY 

In many patients with cancer, the tumor is discovered before it has spread, and it may be cured by surgical 
excision. Some common cancers in which surgery may be curative are those of the stomach, breast, colon, 
lung, and uterus (endometrium). Often, surgical removal of the primary tumor prevents local spread or 
complications, even in the presence of distant disease. A debulking procedure may be used to remove as much 
of the primary tumor mass as possible, even if the tumor is attached to a vital organ and cannot be completely 
removed. After removal of the primary tumor, the patient often receives adjuvant (assisting) radiation therapy 
and/or chemotherapy to prevent recurrence at distant sites. 

The following is a list of terms that describe surgical procedures used in diagnosing and treating cancer. 

cauterization Process of burning tissue to destroy it. Examples are electrocauterization 
(using a needle or snare heated by electric current), laser, dry ice, and 
chemicals. 
core needle biopsy Placement of a large-bore needle that extracts a thin core of tissue. 
cryosurgery Use of subfreezing temperature to destroy tissue. 
en bloc resection Tumor is removed along with a large area of surrounding tissue 
containing lymph nodes. Modified radical mastectomy, colectomy, and 
gastrectomy are examples. 
excisional biopsy Removal of tumor and a margin of normal tissue. This procedure provides 
a specimen for diagnosis and may be curative for small noninvasive 
tumors. 
exenteration Wide resection involving removal of the tumor, its organ of origin, and all 
surrounding tissue in the body space. Pelvic exenteration with removal 
of the uterus, ovaries, bladder, and segments of the large bowel may be 
performed to treat large primary tumors of the uterus. 
fine needle aspiration Placement of a very thin needle inside the tumor mass and extracting 
cells for microscopic evaluation. 
fulguration Destruction of tissue by electric sparks generated by a high-frequency 
current. 
incisional biopsy Piece of tumor is removed for examination to establish a diagnosis. 
More extensive surgical procedure or other forms of treatment, such as 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, are then used to treat the bulk of the 
tumor. 

RADIATION THERAPY (RADIATION ONCOLOGY) 

The goal of radiation therapy (RT) is to deliver a maximal dose of ionizing radiation to the tumor tissue and 
a minimal dose to the surrounding normal tissue. High-dose irradiation (exposure of tissue to radiation) 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 811 


destroys tumor cells and produces damage to DNA. Newer techniques of irradiation use high-energy beams of 
protons (sub-atomic particles) to improve the uniformity (conformality) of dose and to limit damage to normal 
tissues. 

Terms used in the field of radiation therapy for cancer are as follows: 

brachytherapy Implantation of small, sealed containers or seeds of radioactive material 
directly into the tumor (interstitial therapy); or in a cavity of the tumor 
(intracavitary therapy, as in endometrial cancer). An implant may 
be temporary (as in treatment for tumors of the head and neck or 
gynecologic malignancies) or permanent (as with prostatic implants, or 
“seeds,” placed into the affected area of the gland). 
electron beams Low-energy beams for treatment of skin or surface tumors. 
external beam irradiation 
(teletherapy) 
Radiation therapy applied to a tumor from a distant source (linear 
accelerator). 
fields Dimensions of the size of radiation area used to treat a tumor from a 
specific angle. 
fractionation A method of dividing radiation into small, repeated doses rather than 
fewer large doses. Fractionation allows larger total doses to be given while 
causing less damage to normal tissue. 
gray (Gy) Unit of absorbed radiation dose. Historically, the unit in use was rad 
(100 rad equal 1 Gy). 
linear accelerator Large electronic device that produces high-energy x-ray (or photon) 
beams for the treatment of deep-seated tumors (Figure 19-10). 
Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is direct application of radiation 
during surgery using a linear accelerator in the operating room. 
photon therapy Radiation therapy using x-rays or gamma rays. A linear accelerator 
produces photon beams to treat tumors. See the In Person account of a 
woman undergoing radiotherapy on page 828. 

19 
FIGURE 19-10 Linear accelerator. Radiation therapy (photon 
therapy) delivered to a patient positioned under a linear accelerator. 
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced 
mode of high-precision radiotherapy that uses computer-controlled 
linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant 
tumor. This is a type of conformal radiation therapy that uses 
computer technology to create a three-dimensional image of a 
tumor so that rotating beams can shape exactly to the contour of 
the tumor. (Courtesy Dr. Arthur Brimberg, Riverhill Radiation 
Oncology, Yonkers, New York.) 




812 CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 


proton therapy Small subatomic positively charged particles (protons) produced by a 
cyclotron deposit all the absorbed dose at a focused finite point. This 
reduces the dose affecting normal surrounding tissues by at least 50% 
(Figure 19-11A). 
radiocurable tumor Tumor that can be completely eradicated by radiation therapy. Usually, this 
is a localized tumor with no evidence of metastasis. Lymphomas, Hodgkin 
disease, and seminomas of the testes are examples (Figure 19-12). 
radioresistant tumor Tumor that requires large doses of radiation to produce death of the cells. 
Melanoma and renal carcinoma are the most radioresistant. 
radiosensitive tumor Tumor in which irradiation can cause the death of cells without serious 
damage to surrounding tissue (morbidity). Tumors of hematopoietic 
(blood-forming) and lymphatic origins are radiosensitive. 
radiosensitizers Drugs that increase the sensitivity of tumors to x-rays. Many cancer 
chemotherapy drugs, especially 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, sensitize 
tumors and normal tissue to radiation, thereby improving the outcome of 
treatment. 
simulation Study prior to radiation therapy using CT scan and/or MRI to map 
treatment. Simulation is required for all patients undergoing RT. 
stereotactic radiosurgery Single large dose of radiation (Gamma Knife surgery) delivered from 
several different angles under stereotactic (highly precise) guidance to 
destroy a vascular abnormality (arteriovenous malformation, which is a 
tangle of blood vessels in the brain) or to treat small intracranial tumors 
(see Figure 19-11B).

Radiotherapy, although it may be either palliative (relieving symptoms) or curative, can 
produce undesirable side effects on normal body tissues that are incidentally irradiated. 
Some complications due to irradiation of normal tissue surrounding the tumor and in the 
path of the beam of photons may be reversible with time, and recovery takes place soon 
after radiotherapy is completed. Side effects include the following: 

Alopecia (baldness)—may be permanent or temporary with radiation therapy 

Fibrosis (increase in connective tissue) in normal tissues 

Infertility (inability to contribute to conception of a child) 

Mucositis (inflammation and ulceration of mucous membranes)—in the mouth, 

pharynx, vagina, bladder, or large or small intestine 

Myelosuppression (bone marrow depression)—anemia, leukopenia, and thrombo


cytopenia 

Nausea and vomiting—as reaction to radiation therapy to the brain (vomiting center is 

located in the brainstem) or gastrointestinal tract (loss of epithelial lining tissue) 

Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs) 

Secondary tumors (new types of tumors, originating at a site separate from the primary 

tumor)—including sarcomas or carcinomas, or leukemias that may arise from 

damaged tissue 

Xerostomia (dryness of the mouth)—occurs after radiation therapy to the salivary glands 

CHEMOTHERAPY, BIOLOGICAL THERAPY, 
AND DIFFERENTIATING AGENTS 

Chemotherapy 

Cancer chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer using chemicals (drugs). It is the standard 
treatment for many types of cancer, and it produces cures in most patients who 
have testicular cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia (children), and Hodgkin disease. 
Chemotherapy may be used alone or in combination with surgery and irradiation to 
improve cure rates. 

The ideal is to administer drugs that kill large numbers of tumor cells without harming 
normal cells. Because normal cells, such as bone marrow and gastrointestinal lining cells, 
have a rapidly dividing cell population, they suffer considerable damage from antitumor 
drugs. Scientists working in the field of pharmacokinetics measure the rate of disappearance 

19 


814 CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 


of drugs from the bloodstream and tissues. They also use information from animal 
experiments and clinical trials 


to design better routes (oral, intravenous) and schedules 
of administration to achieve the greatest tumor kill with the least toxicity (harm) to 
normal cells. 
Combination chemotherapy is the use of two or more antitumor drugs together to kill a 
specific type of malignant growth. In chemotherapy, drugs are given according to a written 
protocol, or plan, that details the route, schedule, and frequency of doses administered. 
Usually, drug therapy is continued until the patient achieves a complete remission, the 
absence of all signs of disease. At times, chemotherapy is an adjuvant (aid) to surgery. Drugs 
are used to kill possible hidden disease in patients who, after surgery, are otherwise free of 
any evidence of malignancy. 

Drugs cause tumor cells to die by damaging their DNA. Tumor cells with damaged DNA 
undergo apoptosis, or self-destruction. They have impaired capacity to repair their DNA 
and, in general, are less able than normal cells to survive DNA damage due to drugs and 
radiation. 

The following are categories of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. For your reference, 

Table 19-6 lists the specific drugs in each of these categories and the particular cancers they 

are used to treat.

 1. 
Alkylating agents. These are synthetic compounds containing one or two alkyl groups. 
The chemicals interfere with the process of DNA synthesis by attaching to DNA 
molecules. Toxic side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow 
depression (myelosuppression), and alopecia (hair loss). These are common side 
effects because cells in the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and scalp are rapidly 
dividing cells that, along with tumor cells, are susceptible to the lethal effects of 
chemotherapeutic drugs. Most side effects disappear after treatment is suspended. 
2. 
Antibiotics. These drugs are produced by bacteria or fungi. Most act by binding to 
DNA in the cell, thus promoting DNA strand breaks and preventing the replication or 
copying of DNA. Toxic side effects include alopecia, stomatitis (inflammation of the 
mouth), myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal disturbances. 
3. 
Antimetabolites. These drugs inhibit the synthesis of nucleotide components of DNA, 
or they may act as fraudulent copies of normal nucleotides and become incorporated 
into the DNA strand, where they directly block the replication of DNA. Toxic side 
effects are myelosuppression with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; and 
damage to cells that line the mouth and digestive tract, leading to stomatitis, nausea, 
and vomiting. 
Clinical Trials 

19 
Clinical trials are research studies designed to find treatments that work for patients. The studies follow a predefined protocol 

and are divided into four phases: 
Phase I: The experimental drug or treatment is tested in a small group of people (20 to 80) for the first time to evaluate its 
safety. Phase I trials also determine a safe dosage range and schedule of administration (daily or weekly, oral or intravenous, 
and so on). 
Phase II: Experimental treatment is given to a larger group of people (200 to 300) to identify tumor response rate and 
define safety risks for patients with a specific type of cancer. 
Phase III: A larger and more definitive trial is conducted in which hundreds or thousands of subjects take part. Patients are 
randomly assigned to the new treatment or to a standard, established treatment. The effectiveness and overall risk-versusbenefit 
ratio for the experimental treatment are compared with those for standard treatment. A new drug may be 
approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) based on these results. 
Phase IV: Large studies are conducted after the FDA has granted its initial approval of a new treatment for marketing. These 
trials are designed to monitor safety in large populations and identify new indications beyond those already approved.

4. 
Antimitotics. These chemicals are derived from bacteria, fungi, or plants or from 
animals found on coral reefs or in the ocean. Paclitaxel (Taxol) and the vinca alkaloids 
are isolated from plants and block the function of the cell structural protein, the 
microtubule, which is essential for mitosis. They are used frequently in combination 
with other chemotherapeutic agents. Side effects include myelosuppression, alopecia, 
and nerve damage. 
5. 
Hormonal agents. Hormones are a class of chemicals made by endocrine glands in the 
body. Examples are estrogens made in the ovaries and androgens made in the testes 
and adrenal glands. Hormones attach to receptor proteins in target tissues. The 
hormone-receptor complex stimulates certain normal tissues, such as breast or 
uterine lining cells, to divide and grow. Some tumors, such as prostate cancers, 
depend on the presence of a hormone (in this case, androgens) to grow, and hormone 
removal (orchiectomy) leads to tumor regression. Steroid (cholesterol-derived) 
hormones, such as prednisone, have growth-inhibiting effects on leukemias and 
breast cancer. Other compounds, called hormone antagonists, are designed to block 
the growth-promoting effects of estrogens or androgens, and are used in breast cancer 
and prostate cancer, respectively. 
Breast cancers have estrogen receptors. These tumors respond to the removal of estrogen 
by oophorectomy or the use of antiestrogen drugs, such as tamoxifen, which block 
estrogenic effects. Flutamide blocks androgen action and causes regression of prostate 
cancer. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, prevent the conversion of androgen to 
estrogen, and starve breast tumors of their estrogen supply in postmenopausal women. 

Figure 19-13 illustrates the mechanisms of action for various types of cancer 
chemotherapeutic agents. Often, drugs are administered in combination, according to 
carefully planned protocols (regimens). Consult the Evolve site for Chapter 19 to see 
examples of cancer chemotheraputic protocols. 

A new class of anticancer drugs are molecularly targeted drugs.

 
These drugs are 
designed to block the function of growth factors, their receptors, and abnormal or overactive 
signaling pathways in tumor cells. 
Tumor cells can also grow by establishing a new blood supply via angiogenesis (growth 
of new blood vessels). Tumors secrete specific proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which stimulates the formation of new vessels. Antiangiogenic drugs 
interfere with angiogenesis and stop the growth of new blood vessels. An example of this 
type of drug is Avastin (bevacizumab), a monoclonal antibody that destroys VEGF.

 Molecularly Targeted Drugs 

19
Examples are: 
Gleevec (imatinib mesylate)—blocks Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. 
Tarceva (erlotinib)—blocks epidermal growth factor (EGFR) in lung cancer cells. 
Zelboraf (vemurafenib)—blocks mutated BRAF enzyme in 50% of melanoma patients.

Biological Therapy 
Another approach to cancer treatment is to use the body’s own defenses to fight tumor 
cells. Investigators are exploring how the elements of the immune system can be restored, 
enhanced, mimicked, and manipulated to destroy cancer cells. Substances produced by 
normal cells that directly block tumor growth or that stimulate the immune system and 
other body defenses are called biological response modifiers. Examples of these substances 
are interferons (made by lymphocytes), monoclonal antibodies (made by mouse or human 
immune cells and capable of binding to human tumors), colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) 
that stimulate blood-forming cells to combat the myelosuppressive side effects of 
chemotherapy, and interleukins that stimulate the immune system to destroy tumors. 
Consult the Evolve website for Chapter 19 for specific biological agents and their modes 
of action. 
Differentiating Agents 
Some new drugs cause tumor cells to differentiate, stop growing, and die. These include 
ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), a vitamin A derivative, that is highly active against acute 
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), which has similar effects 
on APL. Consult the Evolve website for Chapter 19 for a list of the newest anticancer 
drugs with their modes of action.

LABORATORY TESTS 

cytogenetic analysis Chromosomes of normal or tumor cells are examined for breaks, 
translocations, or deletions of DNA. 
The results of cytogenetic analysis can help confirm the diagnosis of a particular 
form of leukemia or other cancer. 
immunohistochemistry Localizing antigens or proteins in tissues using labeled (colored or 
fluorescent) antibodies. 
This technique allows for evaluation of the presence and amount of specific 
molecules in normal and tumor cells. 
protein marker tests Measure the level of proteins in the blood or on the surface of tumor 
cells. 
These tests diagnose cancer or detect its recurrence after treatment. Examples are:

CLINICAL PROCEDURES 

The following are specialized procedures used to detect or treat malignancies. X-rays, CT scans, MRI, 
and ultrasound imaging (described throughout the text and specifically in Chapter 20) also are important 
diagnostic procedures in oncology. 

bone marrow biopsy 
Aspiration of bone marrow tissue and examination under a microscope 
for evidence of malignant cells. 

bone marrow or stem cell Bone marrow or stem cells are infused intravenously into a patient. 
transplantation In autologous marrow transplantation, marrow previously obtained from the 
patient and stored is reinfused when needed. In allogeneic marrow transplantation 
(all/o = other), marrow is obtained from a living donor other than the recipient. 
In peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, immature blood cells called stem 
cells are selected and harvested from the blood of a patient instead of from the 
bone marrow. After undergoing chemotherapy, the patient gets a reinfusion of the 
stem cells to repopulate the bone marrow with blood cells. 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 825 


core needle biopsy Insertion of a large-bore needle into tissue to remove a core of cells for 
microscopic examination. 
A needle (aspiration) biopsy is the insertion of a fine needle and aspiration 
(extraction) of a sample from a fluid-filled cavity or solid mass of tumor. 
exfoliative cytology Cells are scraped from the region of suspected disease and examined 
under a microscope. 
The Pap test (smear) to detect carcinoma of the cervix and vagina is an example 
(Figure 19-14). 
fiberoptic colonoscopy Visual examination of the colon using a fiberoptic instrument. 
This is an important screening procedure using an endoscope to detect cancer and 
remove premalignant polyps. 
laparoscopy Visual examination of the abdominal cavity using small incisions and a 
laparoscope. Also known as peritoneoscopy. 
mammography X-ray examination of the breast to detect breast cancer.

Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia.) 



826 CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 


PET/CT scan Diagnostic procedure combining CT (computed tomography) and PET 
(positron emission tomography). 
The combination provides a more complete picture of a tumor’s location and 
growth or spread than either done independently. See Figure 19-15. PET/CT uses 
a combination of two machines: one to examine chemical reactions (PET scan) 
and the other to examine physical structures (CT scan). 
radionuclide scans Radioactive substances (radionuclides) are injected intravenously, and 
scans (images) of organs are obtained. 
These tests detect tumor and metastases. Examples of radionuclides are gallium-67 
(whole-body scan), rose Bengal (liver), and technetium-99m (liver and spleen).

IN PERSON: RADIOTHERAPY 
19 
This first-person narrative describes a woman experiencing radiation 
therapy for breast cancer. 

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY 

My life changed forever when I got that phone call that no one wants to 
hear, “your biopsy is malignant.” (See Mary’s In Person piece in Chapter 
8 describing the biopsy procedure.) So after they tell you that you have 
cancer, you are scared to death, begin to contemplate your mortality, and 
wonder how to break the news to your husband, children, loved ones and 
friends. You settle down, and marshal up your strength to fight this beast 
that attacks too many of us. 

After my biopsy, I met with a team that included my surgeon, my radiation oncologist and my medical 
oncologist. It was decided that the best course of action was to perform a lumpectomy to remove the malignant 
tissue in my breast. At the same time, I would also have a sentinel node biopsy to check for lymphatic invasion. 
Surgery would be followed by a course of radiation therapy and then a 5-year regimen of the drug Tamoxifen. 

Approximately three weeks after the surgery, which went very well thanks to my breast surgeon, I met with 
my radiation oncologist. She explained all the benefits and risks associated with radiation. She and her assistant 
exemplified one of the nicest things you can say about your doctors: their bedside manner. It was calming, 
supportive, and reassuring. We had a brief conversation as to the mechanics of beginning this phase of my 
treatment. Then I signed a very scary 4-page list of the minor and major side effects that could occur as a 
consequence of treatment. 

I left their office and went home to clear my calendar, because every week for the next few weeks I would 
have to show up at the same time, same place, five days a week. For those of you who work full time as I do, it 
is a major disruption to your life. Even if you don’t work full time, it is a hassle driving to the hospital, waiting 
for treatment and dealing with delays because the machines malfunction, etc. On my first appointment I did 
not receive any radiation. Instead, the technicians (with whom you will develop a close relationship), create 
your cradle. This is a mold that will hold you in the exact position for all of your treatments. After extensive 
calculations, I was marked on both sides of my body with a special kind of indelible ink. It was sort of a circle 
with an “x” in the middle, vaguely resembling an ancient hieroglyph. I also received a small permanent tattoo 
on the middle of my breast bone, which enables the machine to correctly target the beams. 

THE FIRST TIME 

Ever since I was a small child I have loved science fiction books and movies. My first experience with radiation 
reminded me of a true classic in that genre. Radiation treatment is very regimented; by that I mean they are 
on a very strict schedule. My daily time was 10:30 AM. This means that each day you should arrive 15 minutes 
early so that you can check in (they make a little plastic credit card for you to swipe when you come into to 
the main room and then go into the waiting area). Once you are in the waiting area, one of the technicians will 
come over and take your card, you will go to a locker room and change into a gown and come back and wait 
your turn to enter the chamber of horrors. 




CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 829 


I had no idea what to expect as I was led into this cavernous room. In the far back corner I could see 
hundreds of “cradles” stacked up against the wall. They positioned me into my cradle on this bed; then they 
started to calibrate the machine against the markings on my body. When all the bodily GPS was in sync, they 
all scurried out of the room and went behind the giant lead walls (the cowards). When I was first ushered into 
the room the door was open. Now the door slowly started sliding shut and it sounded like a hundred heavy 
garage doors grinding across the floor. That door must have weighed several tons. After what seemed an 
eternity, a series of strange clicking noises commenced and the giant circular machine that hovered over me 
began to move closer, gyrating slowly back and forth until it was properly fixed. Suddenly a red sign began 
flashing on the wall warning that radiation was in progress. A huge pulse of light shot out and a humming 
sound began. The machine gradually rotated, irradiating different sections of my body. It only lasted about ten 
minutes, which was quite a relief. I was afraid I would be in there a long time. The technicians scattered back 
in, helped me out of my cradle and off I went to the locker room to change. 

THE UGLY 

As you can imagine this routine begins to wear on you. Fatigue from the radiation began to increase slowly, 
and redness appeared like a mild sunburn on the irradiated areas. Starting with the second week of treatment, 
my skin became extremely itchy and I developed folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles). I applied cream 
twice a day, which helped, but didn’t offer much relief. 

I must say that the most disconcerting aspect of radiation treatment involved the daily routine and not the 
actual radiation itself. Patients must adhere to a strict schedule, and this means that you get to know the 
patients ahead of and behind you. They were my radiation buddies. During the course of my treatment, I met 
several very brave men and women, most of them with cancers more serious than my own. Sadly, at least two 
of my friends are no longer with us. One was a young woman in her mid-thirties with two small children. She 
suffered from bone cancer and was having palliative radiation. The cruelty and unfairness of life sat next to me 
every day. After my first week of treatment, I left the hospital and said to my friend, “I may have breast cancer, 
but after meeting all these people, I feel like one of the luckiest people in the world.” 

TREATMENT ENDS 

It seemed like forever, but finally the day came for me to ring the bell. At Hopkins, on the last day of your 
treatment, you walk into the main hall and ring what looks like a small fire bell. Then you have your picture 
taken with one of your technicians. I thought it was over, but not quite! My oncologist explained to me that 
although the treatments were over, the effects of the radiation would keep working in my body. I called it the 
“gift that just keeps giving.” Two weeks after my procedure ended, my skin broke down with blisters and 
bleeding in the worst possible places, the skin under my breast. Being a large breasted woman this was a 
horrid complication. Trying to wear a bra was out of the question until it finally healed. I didn’t want to go to 
my office braless and my collection of underwire brassieres would have rubbed right against the raw part of 
my skin. I bought some very loose fitting tops and did a lot of work from home. Shooting pains would occur 
from the radiation, setting off nerve fibers, subsiding each month. 

I am amazed at what my journey revealed. Most of all, it taught me about how wonderful friends can be, how 
much of a difference support groups can make, and why dedicated medical professionals deserve so much 
thanks and praise. A very lovely woman I met along the way shared some wisdom that I will pass along to all 
of you reading my story. She said, “At first cancer is your whole world, then it becomes a room, then it 
becomes a drawer in that room, and then it becomes a box in the drawer.” I still take that box out once in a 
while, but not as often.

CASE STUDY: SUSPECTED BREAST CANCER 

A 52-year-old married woman presented to her physician with a painless mass in her left breast. During 
breast examination a 1.0-cm, firm, nontender mass was palpated in the upper outer quadrant located at 
the 2 o’clock position, 3 cm from the areola. The mass was not fixed to the skin, and there was no cutaneous 
erythema or edema. No axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was noted. 



CANCER MEDICINE (ONCOLOGY) 831 


An excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. The pathology report described a gross specimen of 
fatty breast tissue. Microscopic evaluation of the nodule revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma. The 
margins of the lumpectomy specimen were free of tumor. Sentinel node biopsy revealed no tumor 
involvement. 

A portion of the specimen was sent for estrogen receptor assay and proved to be positive. The patient 
was informed of the diagnosis and underwent additional studies, including chest x-ray, liver chemistries, 
CBC, and bone scan; all results were negative. 

The patient was staged as having a T1N0M0, stage I carcinoma of the left breast. She was referred to a 
radiation oncologist for primary radiation therapy. After completion of radiotherapy, she was treated with 
tamoxifen. Prognosis is excellent for cure. 

Questions about the Case Study 

1. Where was the primary breast lesion located? 
a. Under the pigmented area of the breast 
b. About an inch and a half above and to the left of the nipple and pigmented area 
c. Near the axilla and under the shoulder blade 
2. Other associated findings were 
a. Redness and swelling 
b. Enlarged lymph nodes under the armpit 
c. None of the above 
3. The tumor was composed of 
a. Dense connective tissue surrounding the tumor cells, giving it a hard structure 
b. Glandular tumor with invasion of surrounding tissue 
c. Cells that had extended into the skin overlying the tumor 
4. What procedure gave evidence that the tumor had not yet metastasized? 
a. Estrogen receptor assay 
b. Excisional biopsy of the mass 
c. Sentinel node biopsy 
5. What additional therapy was undertaken? 
a. Bone scan, liver chemistries, CBC, and chest x-ray 
b. Radiation to the breast 
c. Radiation to the breast and then treatment with an estrogen blocker 
6. Tamoxifen was prescribed because 
a. The tumor was found to be nonresponsive to estrogen 
b. The tumor was found to be stimulated by estrogen, and tamoxifen is an antiestrogen 
c. The tumor was at an advanced stage

PATHOLOGY REPORT: RESECTED SPLEEN, GROSS DESCRIPTION 

The spleen weighs 127 grams and measures 13.0 × 9.2 cm. External surface is smooth, leathery, 
homogeneous, and dark purplish brown. There are no defects in the capsule. The blood vessels of the 
hilum of the spleen are patent, with no thrombi or other abnormalities. On section of the spleen at 2- to 
3-mm intervals, there are three well-defined, pale gray nodules on the cut surface, ranging from 0.5 to 

1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The remainder of the cut surface is homogeneous and dark purple, and the 
tissue consistency is firm. Possible diagnosis: Hodgkin disease. 
Question about the Pathology Report 

1. Which information leads the pathologist to the diagnosis of metastatic cancer? 
a. Blood clots in patent blood vessels 
b. Capsular defects 
c. Uniform, smooth surface 
d. Examination of the spleen showed abnormal growth 
SHORT HISTORIES 

As you read these actual patient histories, congratulate yourself on your understanding of medical terms! 

1. A 28-year-old man feels a hard, non-tender mass in his right testicle. He goes to his doctor, who checks 
his serum human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha fetoprotein levels and finds both quite elevated. 
The tentative diagnosis is a germ cell tumor of the testis. A CT scan of the abdomen reveals extensive 
lymphadenopathy. A chest CT shows nodes in both lungs suggestive of tumor. An orchiectomy confirms 
the diagnosis of testicular cancer. He is given four cycles of chemotherapy with vinblastine, cisplatin, 
and bleomycin and his serum AFP and HCG markers return to normal. His CT scans reveal no evidence 
of residual tumor. 
2. A 42-year-old woman notices repeated episodes of red blood in her stool with each bowel movement. A 
colonoscopy reveals a 4-cm mass arising from the epithelium of the rectum. A biopsy demonstrates a 
rectal adenocarcinoma. An abdominal CT shows two large metastases in the liver and enlarged lymph 
nodes. She first receives 4 cycles of chemotherapy, which cause the liver lesions to shrink significantly 
and the lymph nodes to regress. The remaining liver lesions are surgically resected. Radiation therapy 
with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil) is then administered to shrink the rectal tumor and lymph nodes, 
after which the rectal mass shrinks to a small 1-cm nodule. This is resected surgically. The lymph 
nodes are removed and contain no tumor. 
3. A 62-year-old man has a routine PSA drawn. It is elevated at 5.8 (normal is less than 4.0). A transrectal 
biopsy of the prostate reveals a Gleason grade 6 adenocarcinoma in 4 of 12 biopsy pieces. He chooses to 
be treated with brachytherapy. Treatment causes dysuria, cystitis, and proctitis, but these symptoms 
disappear three weeks after therapy ends, and his PSA is now undetectable.

850 RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE 


20 
INTRODUCTION 

Radiology is the medical specialty concerned with the study and application of x-rays and 
other technologies (such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance) to produce and interpret 
images of the human body for the diagnosis of disease. X-rays are invisible waves of energy 
that are produced by an energy source (such as an x-ray machine or cathode ray tube) and 
are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. 

Nuclear medicine is the medical specialty that uses radioactive substances in the 
diagnosis and treatment of disease. These radioactive substances (radionuclides) are 
materials that emit high-speed particles and energy-containing rays from the interior of 
their matter. The emitted particles and rays are called radioactivity and can be of three 
types: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Gamma rays are used effectively as 
a diagnostic label to trace the path and uptake of chemical substances in the body. 

The professionals involved in these medical fields are varied. A radiologist is a physician 
who specializes in the practice of diagnostic radiology. A nuclear medicine physician 
specializes in diagnostic radionuclide scanning procedures. 

Allied health care professionals who work with physicians in the fields of radiology 
and nuclear medicine are radiologic technologists. Different radiologic technologists 
called radiographers aid physicians in administering diagnostic x-ray procedures, nuclear 
medicine technologists attend to patients undergoing nuclear medicine procedures and 
operate devices under the direction of a nuclear physician, and sonographers aid physicians 
in performing ultrasound procedures. 

RADIOLOGY 

CHARACTERISTICS OF X-RAYS 

Several characteristics of x-rays are useful to physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of 
disease. Some of these characteristics are the following:

 1. 
Ability to cause exposure of a photographic plate. If a photographic plate is placed in 
front of a beam of x-rays, the x-rays, traveling unimpeded through the air, will expose 
the silver coating of the plate and cause it to blacken. 
2. 
Ability to penetrate different substances to varying degrees. X-rays pass through the 
different types of substances in the human body (air in the lungs, water in blood 
vessels and lymph, fat around muscles, and metal such as calcium in bones) with 
varying ease. Air is the least dense substance and allows the greatest transmission. Fat 
is denser, water is next, followed by hard materials, such as calcium in bone, which is 
the densest and transmits least. If the x-rays are absorbed (stopped) by the denser 
body substance (e.g., calcium in bones), they do not reach the photographic plate held 
behind the patient, and white areas are left in the x-ray detector (plate). Figure 20-1 is 
an example of an x-ray photograph. 
A substance is said to be radiolucent if it permits passage of most of the x-rays. 
Lung tissue (containing air) is an example of a radiolucent substance, and it appears 
black on an x-ray image. Radiopaque substances (bones) are those that absorb most of 
the x-rays they are exposed to, allowing only a small fraction of the x-rays to reach the 
x-ray plate. Thus, normally radiopaque, calcium-containing bone appears white on an 
x-ray image.

 3. 
Invisibility. X-rays cannot be detected by sight, hearing, or touch. Workers exposed to 
x-rays must wear a film badge to detect and record the amount of radiation to which 
they have been exposed. The film badge contains a special film that reacts when

and image detector necessary to make the x-ray photograph is shown. Bones tend to stop (absorb) diagnostic 
x-rays, but absorption of the x-ray energy occurs to a lesser degree with soft tissue. This results in the light 
and dark regions that form the image. 

exposed to x-rays. The amount of blackness on the film is an indication of the amount 
of x-rays or gamma rays received by the wearer.

 4. 
Travel in straight lines. This property allows the formation of precise shadow images 
on the x-ray plate and also permits x-ray beams to be directed accurately at a tissue 
site during radiotherapy. 
5. 
Scattering of x-rays. Scattering occurs when x-rays come into contact with any 
material. Greater scatter occurs with dense objects and less scatter with those 
substances that are radiolucent. In addition, because scatter can cause blurring 
(radiographic density that serves no useful purpose) on images, a grid (containing 
thin lead strips arranged parallel to the x-ray beams) is placed in front of the image 
detector to absorb scattered radiation before it strikes the x-ray film. In digital 
imaging, an image receptor replaces film. 
6. 
Ionization. X-rays have the ability to ionize substances through which they pass. 
Ionization is a chemical process in which the energy of an x-ray beam causes 
rearrangement and disruption within a substance, so that previously neutral particles 
are changed to charged particles called ions. This strongly ionizing ability of x-rays is 
a double-edged sword. In x-ray or radiation therapy, the ionizing effect of high-energy 
x-ray beams can help kill cancerous cells and stop tumor growth; however, ionizing 
x-rays in even small doses can affect normal body cells, leading to tissue damage and 
malignant changes. Thus, persons exposed to high doses of x-rays are at risk for the 
development of leukemia, thyroid tumors, breast cancer, or other malignancies.

DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES 
X-Ray Studies 
X-ray imaging is used in a variety of ways to detect pathologic conditions. Digital radiography 
is a form of x-ray imaging in which digital x-ray sensors are used instead of traditional 
photographic film. Thus images can be enhanced and transferred easily, and less radiation 
can be used than in conventional radiology. The most common use of diagnostic x-ray 
studies is in dental practice, to locate cavities in teeth (dental caries). Other areas examined 
include the digestive, nervous, reproductive, and endocrine systems and the chest and 
bones. Mammography uses low-dose x-rays to visualize breast tissue. Some special 
diagnostic x-ray techniques are described next. 
Computed Tomography (CT). The CT scan, sometimes called “CAT scan” (because the 
technique originally was known as “computerized axial tomography”), is made by beaming 
x-rays at multiple angles through a section of the patient’s body. The absorption of all of 
these x-rays, after they pass through the body, is detected and used by a computer to create 
multiple views, especially cross-sectional images (Figure 20-2). The ability of a CT scanner 
to detect abnormalities (the sensitivity of the scanner) is increased with the use of iodinecontaining 
contrast agents, which outline blood vessels and confer additional density to 
soft tissues. 
CT scanners are highly sensitive in detecting disease in bones and can actually provide 
images of internal organs that are impossible to visualize with ordinary x-ray technique. 
Figure 20-3 shows a series of CT scans through various regions of the body. New ultrafast 
CT scanners can produce a three-dimensional (3D) image of a beating heart and surrounding 
blood vessels. State-of-the-art scanners produce images in 64, 128, 256, and 320 slices and 
are called multidetector CT or MDCT scanners. 
Contrast Studies. In x-ray film, the natural differences in the density of body tissues (e.g., 
from air in lung or from calcium in bone) produce contrasting shadow images on the x-ray 
film; however, when x-rays pass through two adjacent body parts composed of substances 
of the same density (e.g., different digestive organs in the abdomen), their images cannot 
be distinguished from one another on the film or on the screen. It is necessary, then, to 
inject a contrast medium into the structure or fluid to be visualized so that a specific part, 
organ, tube, or liquid can be visualized as a negative imprint on the dense contrast agent.

854 RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE 

The following are contrast materials used in diagnostic radiologic studies: 

Barium Sulfate. Barium sulfate is a radiopaque medium that is mixed in water and used for examination of 
the upper and lower GI (gastrointestinal) tract. An upper GI series (UGI) involves oral ingestion of barium 
sulfate so that the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be visualized. A small bowel follow-through 
(SBFT) series traces the passage of barium in a sequential manner as it passes through the small intestine. A 
barium enema (BE) study is a lower GI series that opacifies the lumen (passageway) of the large intestine 
using an enema containing barium sulfate. This test has largely been replaced by endoscopy, which allows 
visualization of the inside of the bowel. 

A double-contrast study uses both a radiopaque and a radiolucent contrast medium. For example, the walls 
of the stomach or intestine are coated with barium and the lumen is filled with air. These radiographs show 
the pattern of mucosal ridges. 

Iodine Compounds. Radiopaque fluids containing up to 50% iodine are used in the following tests: 

angiography 
X-ray image (angiogram) of blood vessels and heart chambers is 
obtained after contrast is injected through a catheter into the 
appropriate blood vessel or heart chamber. In clinical practice, the terms 
angiogram and arteriogram are used interchangeably. Figure 20-4 shows 
coronary angiography, which determines the degree of obstruction of the 
arteries that supply blood to the heart. Figure 20-5A and B shows 
coronary angiograms before and after stenting of the artery. 

cholangiography 
X-ray imaging after injection of contrast into bile ducts. This is typically 
accomplished by injecting contrast directly into the common bile duct 
via a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) or after surgery of the gallbladder or biliary tract (intraoperative 
cholangiography). An alternative route for injection of contrast is via 
a needle through the skin and into the liver. This is percutaneous 
transhepatic cholangiography (Figure 20-6).

pyelography 



20 


X-ray imaging of the renal pelvis and urinary tract. Contrast is injected 
into a vein (intravenous pyelography) or through a catheter placed 
through the urethra, bladder, or ureter and into the renal pelvis 
(retrograde pyelography). Urography also describes the process of 
recording x-ray images of the urinary tract after the introduction of 
contrast. 

Patients may experience side effects caused by iodine-containing contrast substances. 
These effects can range from mild reactions such as flushing, nausea, warmth, or tingling 
sensations to severe, life-threatening reactions characterized by airway spasm, hives, 
laryngeal edema (swelling of the larynx), vasodilation, and tachycardia. Treatment involves 
immediate establishment of an airway and ventilation followed by injections of epinephrine 
(adrenaline), corticosteroids, or antihistamines. 

Digital imaging techniques can be used to enhance conventional and fluoroscopic x-ray 
images. A lower dose of x-ray is used to achieve higher-quality images, and digital images 
can be sent via networks to other locations and computer monitors so that many people can 
share information and assist in the diagnostic process. 

Interventional Radiology. Interventional radiologists perform invasive procedures 
(therapeutic or diagnostic) usually under CT guidance or fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy is the 
use of x-rays and a fluorescent screen to produce real-time video images. Procedures include 
percutaneous biopsy, placement of drainage catheters, drainage of abscesses, occlusion of 
bleeding vessels, and catheter instillation of antibiotics or chemotherapy agents. In addition, 
interventional radiologists perform radiofrequency ablation (removal) of tumors and 
tissues (liver, kidney, adrenals). Neurointerventional radiologists perform endovascular 
procedures including intracranial thrombolysis, head, neck, and intracranial tumor 
embolizations, extracranial angioplasty and stenting. They also perform nonvascular 
procedures, such as intervertebral facet injections, nerve root blocks, and vertebroplasties. 
Vascular interventional radiologists perform laser treatments for varicose veins and uterine 
fibroid embolization. 

Ultrasound Imaging 

Ultrasound imaging, or ultrasonography, uses high-frequency inaudible sound waves that 
bounce off body tissues and are then recorded to give information about the anatomy of an 
internal organ. An instrument called a transducer or probe is placed near or on the skin, 
which is covered with a thin coating of gel to ensure good transmission of sound waves. The 
transducer emits sound waves in short, repetitive pulses. The ultrasound waves move 
through body tissues and detect interfaces between tissues of different densities. An echo 
reflection of the sound waves is formed as the waves hit the various body tissues and bounce 
back to the transducer. 

These ultrasonic echoes are then recorded as a composite picture of the area of the body 
over which the instrument has passed. The record produced by ultrasound is called a 
sonogram. 

Ultrasound imaging is used as a diagnostic tool not only by radiologists but also 
by neurosurgeons and ophthalmologists to detect intracranial and ophthalmic lesions. 
Cardiologists use ultrasound techniques to detect heart valve and blood vessel disorders 
(echocardiography), and gastroenterologists use it to locate abdominal masses outside 
the digestive organs. Similarly, pulmonologists use ultrasound procedures for locating 
and sampling lesions outside the bronchial tubes. Obstetricians and gynecologists use 
ultrasound imaging to differentiate single from multiple pregnancies, as well as to help in 
performing amniocentesis. Other uses are to image benign and malignant tumors and 



RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE 857

determine the size and development of the fetus. Measurements of the head, abdomen, and 
femur are made from ultrasound images obtained in various fetal planes (Figure 20-7). 
Ultrasound imaging has several advantages in that the sound waves are not ionizing and 
do not injure tissues at the energy ranges used for diagnostic purposes. Because water is an 
excellent conductor of the ultrasound beams, patients are requested to drink large quantities 
of water before examination so that the urinary bladder will be distended, allowing better 
viewing of pelvic and abdominal organs. 
Two ultrasound techniques, Doppler ultrasound and color flow imaging, make it possible 
to record blood flow velocity (speed). These techniques are used to image major blood 
vessels to detect obstructions caused by atherosclerotic plaques in patients at risk for stroke. 
Figure 20-8A and B shows Doppler ultrasound scanning and color flow imaging.

Ultrasonography is used in interventional radiology to guide needle biopsy for the 
puncture of cysts, for placing needles during amniocentesis, and for inserting radioactive 
seeds into the prostate (brachytherapy). In endoscopic ultrasonography, a small ultrasound 
transducer is attached to the tip of an endoscope that is inserted into the body. This 
technique is used by gastroenterologists and pulmonologists to obtain high-quality and 
accurate detailed images of the digestive and respiratory systems. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 


uses magnetic fields and radiowaves rather than 
x-rays. Hydrogen protons are aligned and synchronized by placing the body in a strong 
magnetic field. Then the hydrogen molecules relax when the magnetic field is shut down. 
The rates of alignment and relaxation vary from one tissue to the next, producing a sharply 
defined picture. Because bone is virtually devoid of water, it does not image well on MRI. 
The MR technique produces sagittal, coronal (frontal), and axial (cross-sectional) images 
(Figure 20-9).

Why do doctors choose MRI or CT scanning? Differences in use depend on the part of the body viewed. In general, CT is 
useful for visualizing bony structures and solid masses of the chest and abdomen, whereas MRI is better at giving detail in soft 
tissues that have more water molecules.

MRI examinations are performed with and without contrast. The contrast agent most 
commonly used is gadolinium (Gd). As iodine contrast does with CT, gadolinium enhances 
vessels and tissues, increases the sensitivity for lesion detection, and helps differentiate 
between normal and abnormal tissues and structures. MRI provides excellent soft tissue 
images, detecting edema in the brain, providing direct imaging of the spinal cord, detecting 
tumors in the chest and abdomen, and visualizing the cardiovascular system. 
MRI is contraindicated for patients with pacemakers or metallic implants because the 
powerful magnet can alter position and functioning of such devices. However, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved new pacemakers that can be safely used 
with MRI. The sounds (loud tapping) heard during the test are caused by the pulsing of the 
magnetic field as the device scans the body. See the In Person story on page 868. 
Figure 20-10 summarizes radiologic diagnostic techniques. 
X-RAY POSITIONING 
In order to take the best picture of the part of the body being radiographed, the patient, 
detector, and x-ray tube must be positioned in the most favorable alignment possible. 
Radiologists use special terms to refer to the direction of travel of the x-ray through the 
patient. X-ray Terms describing the direction of the x-ray beam follow and are illustrated in 
Figure 20-11: 
1. Posteroanterior (PA) view. In this most commonly requested chest x-ray view, x-rays 
travel from a posteriorly placed source to an anteriorly placed detector. 
2. Anteroposterior (AP) view. X-rays travel from an anteriorly placed source to a 
posteriorly placed detector. 
3. Lateral view. In a left lateral view, x-rays travel from a source located to the right of 
the patient to a detector placed to the left of the patient. 
4. Oblique view. X-rays travel in a slanting direction at an angle from the perpendicular 
plane. Oblique views show regions or structures ordinarily hidden and superimposed 
in routine PA and AP views.

NUCLEAR MEDICINE 

RADIOACTIVITY AND RADIONUCLIDES 

The spontaneous emission of energy in the form of particles or rays coming from the 
interior of a substance is called radioactivity. A radionuclide (or radioisotope) is a substance 
that gives off high-energy particles or rays as it disintegrates. Radionuclides are produced 
in either a nuclear reactor or a charged-particle accelerator (cyclotron) or by irradiating 
stable substances, causing disruption and instability. Half-life is the time required for a 
radioactive substance (radionuclide) to lose half of its radioactivity by disintegration. 
Knowledge of a radionuclide’s half-life is important in determining how long the radioactive 
substance will emit radioactivity when in the body. The half-life must be long enough to 
allow for diagnostic imaging but as short as possible to minimize patient exposure to 
radiation. 

Radionuclides emit three types of radioactivity: alpha particles, beta particles, and 
gamma rays. Gamma rays, which have greater penetrating ability than alpha and beta 
particles, and more ionizing power, are especially useful to physicians in both the diagnosis 
and the treatment of disease. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is essentially a pure gamma 
emitter with a half-life of 6 hours. Its properties make it the most frequently used 
radionuclide in diagnostic imaging. 

NUCLEAR MEDICINE TESTS: IN VITRO 
AND IN VIVO PROCEDURES 

Nuclear medicine physicians use two types of tests in the diagnosis of disease: in vitro 
(in the test tube) procedures and in vivo (in the body) procedures. In vitro procedures 
involve analysis of blood and urine specimens using radioactive chemicals. For example, a 
radioimmunoassay (RIA) is an in vitro procedure that combines the use of radioactive 
chemicals and antibodies to detect hormones and drugs in a patient’s blood. The test allows 
the detection of minute amounts of substances or compounds. RIA is used to monitor the 
amount of digitalis, a drug used to treat heart disease, in a patient’s bloodstream and can 
detect hypothyroidism in newborn infants. 



RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE 861 


In vivo tests trace the amounts of radioactive substances within the body. They are given 
directly to the patient to evaluate the function of an organ or to image it. For example, 
in tracer studies a specific radionuclide is incorporated into a chemical substance and 
administered to a patient. The combination of the radionuclide and a drug or chemical is 
called a radiopharmaceutical (or radiolabeled compound). Each radiopharmaceutical is 
designed to concentrate in a certain organ. The organ can then be imaged using the 
radiation given off by the radionuclide. 

A sensitive, external detection instrument called a gamma camera is used to determine 
the distribution and localization of the radiopharmaceutical in various organs, tissues, and 
fluids (Figure 20-12). The amount of radiopharmaceutical at a given location is proportional 
to the rate at which the gamma rays are emitted. Nuclear medicine studies depict the 
physiologic behavior (how the organ works) rather than the specific anatomy of an organ. 

The procedure of making an image by tracking the distribution of radioactive substance 
in the body is radionuclide scanning. Uptake refers to the rate of absorption of the 
radiopharmaceutical into an organ or tissue. 

Radiopharmaceuticals are administered by different routes to obtain a scan of a specific 
organ in the body. For example, in the case of a lung scan, the radiopharmaceutical is given 
intravenously (for perfusion studies, which rely on passage of the radioactive compound 
through the capillaries of the lungs) or by inhalation of a gas or aerosol (for ventilation 
studies), which fills the air sacs (alveoli). The combination of these tests permits sensitive 
and specific diagnosis of clots in the lung (pulmonary emboli). 

Other diagnostic procedures that use radionuclides include the following:

 1. 
Bone scan. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is used to label phosphate substances and 
then is injected intravenously. The phosphate compound is taken up preferentially by 
bone, and the skeleton is imaged in 2 or 3 hours. Waiting 2 to 3 hours allows much of 
the radiopharmaceutical to be excreted in urine and allows for better visualization 
of the radioactive material remaining in the skeleton. The scan detects infection, 
inflammation, or tumors involving the skeleton, which appear as areas of high uptake 
(“hot spots”) on the scan. See Figure 15-36 on page 620.

2. Lymphoscintigraphy. 
This type of nuclear medicine imaging provides pictures 
(scintigrams) of the lymphatic system. A radiotracer (radioactive isotope) is injected 
under the skin or deeper using a small needle. A gamma camera then takes a series of 
images of an area of the body. Physicians perform lymphoscintigraphy to identify a 
sentinel lymph node (the first lymph node to receive lymph drainage from a tumor), 
identify areas of lymph node blockage, or evaluate lymphedema (accumulation of 
fluid in soft tissues leading to swelling). 
3. 
Positron emission tomography (PET scan). This radionuclide technique produces 
images of the distribution of radioactivity (through emission of positrons) in a region 
of the body. It is similar to the CT scan, but radioisotopes are used instead of contrast 
and x-rays. The radionuclides are incorporated (by intravenous injection) into the 
tissues to be scanned, and an image is made showing where the radionuclide is 
or is not being metabolized. The most common radionuclide is radiolabeled 
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), but others are in use. PET scanning has determined 
that schizophrenics do not metabolize glucose equally in all parts of the brain and 
that drug treatment can bring improvement to these regions. Areas of metabolic 
deficiency can be pinpointed by PET, making it helpful in diagnosing and treating 
other neurologic disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and Alzheimer disease. 
Alternatively, areas of infection, inflammation, and tumor demonstrate increased 
metabolic activity, highlighted as hot spots on the PET scan (Figure 20-13). 
4. 
PET/CT scan. This scan combines PET and CT techniques to produce a more accurate 
image than PET or CT alone. See Figure 20-14. It is often used to detect cancer and 
metastases, especially to determine if the cancer is responding to treatment. 
5. 
Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This technique involves 
an intravenous injection of radioactive tracer (such as Tc-99m) and the computer 
reconstruction of a 3D image based on a composite of many views. Clinical applications 
include detecting liver tumors, detecting cardiac ischemia, and evaluating bone 
disease of the spine.

Scintigraphy is the process of obtaining an image using a radioisotope. The term is derived from Latin scintilla, meaning spark. 
Bone scintigraphy is commonly called a bone scan, and lung scintigraphy is commonly called a lung scan.

Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi (Cardiolite) scan. This radiopharmaceutical is 
injected intravenously and traced to heart muscle. An exercise tolerance test (ETT) is 
used with it for an ETT-MIBI scan. In a multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scan, 
Tc-99m is injected intravenously to study the motion of the heart wall muscle and the 
ventricle’s ability to eject blood (ejection fraction). 
7. 
Thallium scan. Thallium-201 (TL-201) is injected intravenously to evaluate myocardial 
perfusion. A high concentration of TL-201 is present in well-perfused heart muscle 
cells, but infarcted or scarred myocardium does not take up any thallium, showing up 
as “cold spots.” If the defective area is ischemic, the cold spots fill in (become “warm”) 
on delayed images (obtained later). 
8. 
Thyroid scan. In a thyroid scan, an iodine radionuclide, usually iodine-123 (I-123), is 
administered orally, and the scan reveals the size, shape, and position of the thyroid 
gland. Alternatively, radioactive technetium can be administered intravenously. 
Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (adenomas) accumulate higher amounts of 
radioactivity and are termed “hot.” Thyroid carcinoma does not concentrate 
radioiodine well and is seen as a “cold” spot on the scan. Figure 20-15 shows thyroid 
scans.

occurrence when normal tissue is replaced by malignancy.

A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) study is performed to assess the function of the 
thyroid gland (such as hyperthyroidism). The patient is given radioactive iodine (in this 
case, I-131), also called radioiodine, in liquid or capsule form, and then a sensor is placed 
over the thyroid gland. It detects gamma rays emitted from the radioactive tracer, which is 
taken up by the thyroid more readily than by other tissues. Radioiodine also is used to treat 
hyperthyroidism, thyroid nodules, or thyroid cancer. After the patient swallows the I-131, 
it is absorbed into the bloodstream and then travels to the thyroid gland, where it destroys 
overactive thyroid tissue.

The following first-person narrative provides a detailed look at two 
common diagnostic procedures-CT and MRI-from the perspective of the 
patient. It was written by a 77-year-old woman with head and neck cancer. 

CT—COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY 

Before an upcoming surgical procedure, I was told that I would need to have 
a CT scan. The doctors wanted to see if the cancer on my scalp had spread 
into the bones in my skull. They explained that these images of my head 
would be in thin “slices,” taken as the CT camera rotated around me. 

When I arrived in the room, I saw the CT machine. It was a large, circular 
hollow tube about 18 inches wide. There was a narrow table through the 
center. It was clear to me immediately that I would not have to worry about feeling “closed in.” I lay down on 
the table, and the technician explained he would add contrast through an intravenous (IV) line halfway through 
the procedure. 

The table was rolled into the machine to a specific spot where a series of pictures were taken. There were 
several short periods when I was asked to stay as still as possible and hold my breath. The noise was minimal, 
just soft whirring and clicking. Halfway through the procedure, I was slid out of the machine on the table so 
that the contrast could be added to the IV line. Once I was back in the machine, more pictures were taken and 
the test was completed with a minimum of discomfort, much to my grateful surprise. 

MRI-MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING 

Before yet another surgery procedure, my doctors requested an MRI exam. This time, they wanted to get the 
best possible image of my malignant tumor and the surrounding area. They explained that the MRI and CT 
procedures are similar in that they both produce images in thin slices, but that MRI shows more detail, 
especially of soft tissue. 

The technician confirmed I had nothing metal (such as a pacemaker or surgical screws) inside or on my 
body. The magnet that is used in the MRI machine is so strong that it could cause any metal objects to shift. 
This movement could disrupt the imaging process or cause damage to tissue in my body. 

The MRI machine is a 6 foot-long round tube, open on both ends. Because the body part to be examined was 
my head, a rubber shield was placed over and very close to my face to hold me in the correct position. I was 
then rolled inside to the middle of the tube. This was really uncomfortable for me because I have mild 
claustrophobia. I took deep breaths to relax myself. 

Although the technicians had told me the procedure would be loud, I was still taken aback by just how loud 
it was inside the tube. Even though I was wearing earplugs, the sound was like the pounding of huge hammers 
held by giant arms, or of heavy-duty jackhammers. At the same time, there was an abrupt shaking of the entire 
machine from side to side. I knew immediately that this could be an overwhelming experience, so I used the 
“relax-substitution” method to replace these violent sounds with more familiar ones. I remembered a very 
loud time as my family and I made our way to Nantucket Island on a ferry for a brief vacation. Now the 
previously strident and threatening sound was replaced by the welcoming sound of the ferry horn bellowing a 
happy welcome to the visitors’ smiling faces as they came onto the ferry with straw hats, sunscreen, backpacks, 
and duffel bags. This relaxation method was extremely effective for me. I was then rolled out of the machine 
for addition of the IV contrast, and the process was repeated. 

I am still amazed that the doctors could get such detailed information on what was going on inside my body 
using these two tests.

Answers to the questions are found on page 876. 

CASE STUDY: MELANOMA FOLLOW-UP 

Bill Smith, a 51-year-old sales representative, was initially diagnosed with stage III melanoma 4 years ago. 
He underwent surgery and received interferon treatment at that time. At his 3-month follow-up CT 
evaluation last year, Mr. Smith received bad news. The CT scan indicated a small 1-cm nodule that could 
be a melanoma metastasis. To confirm the diagnosis, Mr. Smith underwent a PET scan. 

He was admitted to the nuclear medicine unit of the hospital on the morning of the scan. He had been 
instructed to fast (no food or beverage 12 hours before the scan). The nuclear medicine physician had told 
him especially not to eat any type of sugar, which would compete with the radiopharmaceutical 18F-FDG 
(radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose), a radioactive glucose molecule that travels to every cell in the body. 

The PET scan began with an injection of a trace amount of 18F-FDG by the physician. Bill was asked to 
lie still for about an hour in a dark, quiet room and to avoid talking to prevent the compound from 
concentrating in the tongue and vocal cords. The waiting time allowed the 18F-FDG to be absorbed and 
released from normal tissue. After emptying his bladder, Bill reclined on a bed that moved slowly and 
quietly through a PET scanner, a large tube similar to a CT scanner. The radioactive glucose emits charged 
particles called positrons, which interact with electrons, producing gamma rays that are in turn detected 
by the scanner. Color-coded images indicate the intensity of metabolic activity throughout the body. 
Cancerous cells absorb more radioactive glucose than noncancerous cells. The malignant cells show up 
brighter on the PET scan. 

Bill’s PET scan proved the CT wrong. His melanoma had not metastasized. He returned home quite 
relieved.

Circle the correct term to complete each sentence. 

1. Mr. Jones was scheduled for ultrasound-guided thoracentesis. He was sent to the (interventional 
radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine) department for the procedure. 
2. In order to better visualize Mr. Smith’s small intestine, Dr. Wong ordered a (perfusion study, 
SBFT, hysterosalpingography). She hoped to determine why he was having abdominal pain and 
diarrhea. 
3. After a head-on automobile collision, Sam was taken to the emergency department in an 
unconscious state. The paramedics suspected head trauma, and the doctors ordered an emergency 
(PET scan, U/S, CT scan) of his head. 
4. In light of Sue’s symptoms of fever, cough, and malaise, the doctors thought that the consolidated, 
hazy (radioisotope, radiolucent, radiopaque) area on the chest x-ray represented a pneumonia. 
5. Fred, a lung cancer patient, experienced a seizure recently. His oncologist ordered a brain 
(ultrasound, pulmonary angiogram, MRI) that showed a tumor involving the left frontal lobe of 
the brain. Fred was treated with Gamma Knife irradiation, and the tumor decreased in size. He has 
had no further seizures. 
6. Tom recently developed a cough and fever. A chest x-ray and (CT, myelogram, IVP) of the chest 
show that a (pelvic, spinal, mediastinal) mass is present. (Mediastinoscopy, Cystoscopy, Lumbar 
puncture) and biopsy of the mass reveal Hodgkin disease on histopathologic examination. He is 
treated with chemotherapy, and his symptoms disappear. A repeat x-ray shows that the mass has 
decreased remarkably, and a (SPECT, MRI, PET) scan shows no uptake of 18F-FDG in the chest, 
indicating that the mass is fibrosis and not tumor. 
7. Paola, a 50-year-old woman with diabetes, experiences chest pain during a stress test, and her (U/S, 
ECG, EEG) shows evidence of ischemia. A (contrast agent, transducer, radiopharmaceutical) 
called technetium Tc 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) is injected IV, and uptake is assessed with a 
(probe, CT scanner, gamma camera), which shows an area of poor perfusion in the left ventricle. 
8. Sally has a routine pelvic examination, and her (neurologist, gynecologist, urologist) feels an 
irregular area of enlargement in the anterior wall of the uterus. A pelvic (angiogram, U/S study, 
PET scan) is performed, which demonstrates the presence of fibroids in the uterine wall. The 
examination involves placing a gel over her abdominopelvic area and applying a (ultrasound 
transducer, radionuclide, MRI scanner) to send/receive sound vibrations to/from the pelvic region. 
9. Sally was having palpitations in the early evening. An ECG revealed possible left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Her physician ordered an (ECHO, EUS, UGI) to rule out valvular heart disease. 
10. Joe, a 75-year-old man with a long smoking history, noticed blood in his sputum. His primary care 
physician ordered a/an (abdominal CT, chest CT, ultrasound of his heart) to make the diagnosis.

882 PHARMACOLOGY 


INTRODUCTION 


Drugs (medicines) are substances used to prevent or treat a condition or disease. Some 
drugs are obtained from parts of plants, such as the roots, leaves, and fruit. An example of 
a plant-derived drug is a cardiac medicine, digitalis (from the foxglove plant). Other drugs 
(antibiotics such as penicillin) are obtained from yeast, molds, and fungi. Drugs also are 
obtained from animals; for example, hormones are secretions from the glands of animals. 
Some drugs are synthesized in a laboratory. Anticancer drugs such as methotrexate and 
5-fluorouracil are laboratory-synthesized drugs. Vitamins are drugs that are isolated from 
plant or animal sources and are contained in foods. 

A pharmacist prepares and dispenses drugs through a pharmacy (drugstore) on a written 
order from a physician. The order is called a prescription. Currently, most schools or 
colleges of pharmacy offer a PharmD (doctor of pharmacy) degree after 6 or 7 years of study. 
As a health care professional, a pharmacist cooperates with, consults with, and sometimes 
advises licensed practitioners concerning drugs. In addition, the pharmacist answers 
patients’ questions about their prescription. A pharmacy technician helps licensed 
pharmacists provide medication and other health care products to patients. 

Pharmacology is the study of the discovery, properties, uses, and actions of drugs. A 
pharmacologist is either an MD (doctor of medicine) or a PhD (doctor of philosophy) who 
specializes in the study of medicines. Pharmacology contains many subdivisions of study: 
medicinal chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, molecular pharmacology, 
chemotherapy, and toxicology. 

Medicinal chemistry is the study of new drug synthesis and the relationship between 
chemical structure and biological effects. Pharmacodynamics involves the study of a drug’s 
effects in the body. Pharmacokinetics is the study of a drug’s absorption (how drugs pass 
into the bloodstream), distribution into body compartments, metabolism (changes that 
drugs undergo within the body), and excretion (removal of the drug from the body) over a 
period of time. 

Molecular pharmacology involves the interaction of drugs and subcellular entities, such 
as DNA, RNA, and enzymes. It provides important information about the mechanism of 
action of drugs. 

Chemotherapy is the study of drugs that destroy microorganisms, parasites, or malignant 
cells within the body. Chemotherapy includes treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. 

Toxicology is the study of the harmful effects of drugs and chemicals on the body. 
Toxicologic studies in animals are required by law before new drugs can be tested in humans. 
A toxicologist also is interested in finding proper antidotes to any harmful effects of drugs. 
Antidotes are substances given to neutralize unwanted effects of drugs.

DRUG NAMES, STANDARDS, AND REFERENCES 

NAMES 

A drug can have three different names. The chemical name specifies the exact chemical 
makeup of the drug. This name often is long and complicated. 

The generic name, typically shorter and less complicated, identifies the drug legally and 
scientifically. The generic name becomes public property after 17 years of use by the original 
manufacturer, and any drug manufacturer may use it thereafter. There is only one generic 
name for each drug. 

The brand name or trademark is the private property of the individual drug manufacturer, 
and no competitor may use it. A brand name (also called trade name) often has the 
superscript . after or before the name, indicating that it is a registered brand name. Drugs 
can have several brand names, because each manufacturer producing the drug gives it a 
different name. When a specific brand name is ordered on a prescription by a physician, it 
must be dispensed by the pharmacist; no other brand name may be substituted. It is usual 
practice to capitalize the first letter of a brand name. 

The following example shows the chemical, generic, and brand names for the antibiotic 
drug amoxicillin; note that the drug has several brand names but only one generic, or 
official, name: 

CHEMICAL NAME GENERIC NAME BRAND NAMES 
[2S,5R,6R]-6-[(R)-(–)-2-amino-2-(pamoxicillin 
Amoxil 
hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3,3-dimethyl-Polymox 
7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0] Trimox 
heptane-2-carboxylic acid 

STANDARDS 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the legal responsibility for deciding 
whether a drug may be disseminated and sold. It sets strict standards for efficacy 
(effectiveness) and purity and requires extensive experimental testing in animals and people 
before it approves a new drug for sale for a specific medical use, or indication, such as for 
treatment of tuberculosis. An independent committee of physicians, pharmacologists, 
pharmacists, and manufacturers, called the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), reviews 
the available commercial drugs and continually reappraises their effectiveness. Three 
important standards of the USP are that the drug must be safe, clinically useful (effective 
for patients), and available in pure form (made by good manufacturing methods). If a drug 
has USP after its name, it has met with the standards of the Pharmacopeia. 

REFERENCES 

Two large reference listings of drugs are available at libraries and hospitals. The most 
complete and up-to-date listing is the hospital formulary, which gives information about 
the characteristics of drugs and their clinical usage (application to patient care) as approved 
by that particular hospital. 

The Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR) is published by a private firm, and drug 
manufacturers pay to have their products listed. The PDR is a useful reference with several 
different indices to identify drugs, along with a complete description of the drug’s properties 
and approved indications. It also gives precautions, warnings about side effects, and 
information about the recommended dosage and administration of each drug.

ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS 

The route of administration of a drug (how it is taken into the body) determines how well 
it is absorbed into the blood, and its speed and duration of action. 

Various methods of administering drugs are: 

Oral Administration. Drugs given by mouth are slowly absorbed into the bloodstream 
through the stomach or intestinal wall. This method, although convenient for the patient, 
has several disadvantages. If the drug is destroyed in the digestive tract by digestive juices, 
or if the drug is unable to pass through the intestinal wall, it will be ineffective. Oral 
administration is also a disadvantage if a rapid onset of action is desired. It takes several 
hours for oral medication to be fully absorbed into the bloodstream. 

Sublingual Administration. Drugs placed under the tongue dissolve in the saliva. For some 
agents, absorption may be rapid. Nitroglycerin tablets are administered in this way to treat 
attacks of angina (chest pain). 

Rectal Administration. Suppositories (cone-shaped objects containing drugs) and aqueous 
solutions are inserted into the rectum. Drugs are given by rectum when oral administration 
presents difficulties, as when the patient is nauseated and vomiting. 

Parenteral Administration. Injection of drug from a syringe (tube) through a hollow 
needle placed under the skin, into a muscle, vein, or body cavity. There are several types of 
parenteral injections and instillations:

 1. 
Intracavitary instillation. This injection is made into a body cavity, such as the 
peritoneal or pleural cavity. For example, drugs may be introduced into the pleural 
cavity in people who have pleural effusions due to malignant disease. The drug causes 
the pleural surfaces to adhere, thereby obliterating the pleural space and preventing 
the accumulation of fluid. This procedure is known as pleurodesis. 
2. 
Intradermal injection. This shallow injection is made into the upper layers of the skin 
and is used chiefly in skin testing for allergic reactions. 
3. 
Subcutaneous (hypodermic) injection (subQ). A small hypodermic needle is 
introduced into the subcutaneous tissue under the skin, usually on the upper arm, 
thigh, or abdomen. Insulin is injected daily via this route. 
4. 
Intramuscular injection (IM). The buttock or upper arm is the usual site for this 
injection into muscle. When drugs are irritating to the skin or when a large volume 
of solution must be administered, IM injections are used. 
5. 
Intrathecal instillation. This instillation occurs in the space under the membranes 
(meninges) surrounding the spinal cord and brain. Methotrexate (a cancer 
chemotherapeutic drug) is introduced intrathecally for treatment of leukemia 
involving the spinal canal. 
6. 
Intravenous injection (IV). This injection is given directly into a vein. It is used when 
an immediate effect from the drug is desired or when the drug cannot be safely 
introduced into other tissues. Good technical skill is needed with intravenous 
injections because leakage of a drug into surrounding tissues may result in irritation 
and inflammation. Some medicines, such as anticancer drugs, are dissolved in a large 
volume of saline (sterile salt solution) and given by a several-hour-long intravenous 
infusion. 
7. 
Pumps. Battery-powered pumps may be used for continuous administration of drugs 
by the subcutaneous or intravenous route. 
Inhalation. Vapors, or gases, taken into the nose or mouth are absorbed into the bloodstream 
through the thin walls of air sacs in the lungs. Aerosols (particles of drug suspended in 
air) are administered by inhalation, as are many anesthetics. Examples of aerosols

are pentamidine, used to prevent a form of pneumonia associated with acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and various aerosolized medicines used to treat

Topical Application. Drugs are applied locally on the skin or mucous membranes of the 
body. Antiseptics (against infection) and antipruritics (against itching) commonly are used 
as ointments, creams, and lotions. Transdermal patches are used to deliver drugs (such as 
estrogen for hormone replacement therapy, pain medications, and nicotine for smoking 
cessation programs) continuously through the skin.

DRUG ACTIONS AND INTERACTIONS 

When a drug enters the body, the target substance with which the drug interacts to produce 
its effects is called a receptor. A drug may cross the cell membrane to reach its intracellular 
receptor or may react with a receptor on the cell’s surface. The dose of a drug is the amount 
of drug administered, usually measured in milligrams or grams. Schedule is the exact 
timing and frequency of drug administration. 

Various actions and interactions of drugs in the body can occur after they have been 
absorbed into the bloodstream. 

Additive Action. If the combination of two similar drugs is equal to the sum of the effects 
of each, then the drugs are called additive. For example, if drug A gives 10% tumor kill as a 
chemotherapeutic agent and drug B gives 20% tumor kill, using A and B together would 
give 30% tumor kill. 

If two drugs give less than an additive effect, they are called antagonistic. If they produce 
greater than additive effects, they are synergistic (as described next). 

Synergism. A combination of two drugs sometimes can cause an effect that is greater than 
the sum of the individual effects of each drug given alone. For example, INH (isoniazid) and 
rifampin, two antibiotic drugs, are given together in the treatment of tuberculosis because 
of their synergistic effect. 

Response. This is a desired and beneficial effect of a drug. Lowering blood pressure by 
antihypertensive drugs is an example. 

Tolerance. For some drugs, the effects of a given dose diminish as treatment continues, and 
increasing amounts are needed to produce the same effect. Tolerance is a feature of addiction 
to drugs such as morphine and meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol). Addiction is the 
physical and psychological dependence on and craving for a drug and the presence of clearly 
unpleasant effects when that drug or other agent is withdrawn. Controlled substances 
are drugs that produce dependence and have potential for abuse or addiction. See pages 
905-906 in the Practical Applications section for information about these drugs. 

DRUG TOXICITY 

Drug toxicity is the unwanted and potentially dangerous effects of some drugs. Idiosyncrasy 
is an example of an unpredictable type of drug toxicity. This is any unexpected and 
uncommon side effect that develops after administration of a drug. For example, in 
some people, penicillin causes an idiosyncratic reaction, such as anaphylaxis (acute 
hypersensitivity with asthma and shock). Anaphylaxis occurs as a result of exposure to a 
previously encountered drug or foreign substance (antigen). 

Other types of drug toxicity are more predictable and are based on the dosage of the drug 
given. Physicians are trained to be aware of the potential toxic effects of all drugs that they 
prescribe. Iatrogenic (produced by treatment) disorders can occur, however, as a result of 
mistakes in drug use or because of individual sensitivity to a given agent. 

Side effects are toxic effects that routinely result from the use of a drug. They often 
occur with the usual therapeutic dosage of a drug and generally are tolerable and reversible 
when the drug is discontinued. For example, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia are common 
side effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat cancer. Other, rare side effects may 
be life-threatening, such as severe allergic reactions. 

Contraindications are factors in a patient’s condition that make the use of a drug 
dangerous and ill advised. For example, in the presence of kidney failure, it is unwise to 
administer a drug, such as methotrexate, that is normally eliminated by the kidneys because 
excess drug will accumulate in the body and cause adverse effects. 



PHARMACOLOGY 887 


Resistance is a lack of beneficial response, and it is seen when drugs that used to be 
effective are unable to control the disease process in a particular patient. It is often seen in 
serious bacterial infection or cancer. 

CLASSES OF DRUGS 

The following are major classes of drugs with indications for their use. Specific drugs in 
each class are included in tables for your reference (note that the brand names are 
capitalized). Appendix IV is a complete list of these drugs and their class or type. Notice that 
many drug types end with the adjectival suffix -ic, meaning pertaining to, although they are 
used as nouns. 

ANALGESICS 

An analgesic (alges/o = sensitivity to pain) is a drug that lessens pain. Mild analgesics relieve 
mild to moderate pain, such as myalgias, headaches, and toothaches. More potent analgesics 
are narcotics or opioids, which are derived from opium. These drugs may induce stupor (a 
condition of near-unconsciousness and reduced mental and physical activity). They are 
used only to relieve severe pain because they may produce dependence. 

Some non-narcotic analgesics reduce fever, pain, and inflammation and are used for 
joint disorders (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), painful menstruation, and acute 
pain due to minor injuries or infection. These agents are not steroid hormones (such as 
cortisone) and are known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs act 
on tissues to inhibit prostaglandins (hormone-like substances that sensitize peripheral 
pain receptors). A newer class of NSAIDs is the COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) inhibitors. These 
agents block prostaglandin production. They relieve pain and inflammation as do traditional 
NSAIDs, but produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects than NSAIDs. However, they may 
increase the risk of clots and heart attacks. Examples of COX-2 inhibitors are Celebrex and 
Bextra, which are listed in Table 21-2 with other analgesics.

ANESTHETICS 

An anesthetic is an agent that reduces or eliminates sensation. This effect may occur in all 
tissues of the body (general anesthetic) and puts a patient asleep, or may be limited to a 
particular region (local anesthetic). General anesthetics are used for surgical procedures. 
They depress the activity of the central nervous system, producing loss of consciousness, 
and block the perception of pain. Local anesthetics inhibit the conduction of pain impulses 
in sensory nerves in the region in which they are injected or applied. An example is dental 
anesthesia with a local Novocain injection. 

Table 21-2 gives examples of specific anesthetics. 

ANTIBIOTICS AND ANTIVIRALS 

An antibiotic is a chemical substance produced by a microorganism (bacterium, yeast, or 
mold) that inhibits (bacteriostatic) or kills (bactericidal) bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The 
use of antibiotics (penicillin was first in general use in 1945) has made it possible to cure 
many conditions such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and streptococcal pharyngitis 
(“strep throat”). Caution about the use of antibiotics is warranted because they are powerful 
agents. Like all drugs, they have side effects. Also, with indiscriminate use of antibiotics, 
bacteria and fungi can develop resistance to a particular agent. Infections caused by these 
resistant bacteria can spread and may be difficult or impossible to cure. 

Antifungal medications treat fungal infections. These infections commonly occur in 
the skin (ringworm), vagina (moniliasis or candidiasis), mouth, bloodstream, and other 
organs. Antitubercular drugs treat tuberculosis, a chronic and often drug-resistant 
infection. Antiviral drugs are used against infections due to viruses, such as herpesviruses, 
Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 

Table 21-3 lists types of antibiotics (such as antifungal and antitubercular drugs) and 
antiviral drugs and gives specific examples of each. 

ANTICOAGULANTS AND ANTIPLATELET DRUGS 

Anticoagulants prevent clotting (coagulation) of blood. They prevent formation of clots or 
break up clots in blood vessels in conditions such as thrombosis and embolism. They also 
are used to prevent coagulation in preserved blood used for transfusions. Heparin is a 
natural anticoagulant purified from pig intestine or bovine (cow) lung. It is found in the 
granules of certain white blood cells. A more easily administered form of heparin called 
low-molecular-weight heparin (Fragmin, Lovenox) is self-injected on a daily basis and 
requires no monitoring of blood clotting ability, as is done with regular heparin. Other 
anticoagulants, including warfarin (Coumadin), are manufactured. Coumadin blocks the 
formation of a number of clot-forming factors in the blood. Its action is reversed by 
vitamin K. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) dissolves clots and is used to open 
vessels after myocardial infarction.

Antiplatelet drugs reduce the tendency of platelets to stick together. Aspirin is an example 
of an antiplatelet drug; daily aspirin prophylaxis is recommended for patients with coronary 
artery disease and for those who have had heart attacks. Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) 
inhibits clumping of platelets and is used to prevent clotting after heart attacks and blood 
vessel procedures, such as angioplasty.

ANTICONVULSANTS 

An anticonvulsant prevents or reduces the frequency of convulsions in various types

ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND ANTI-ALZHEIMER DRUGS 

Antidepressants treat symptoms of depression. They can elevate mood, increase physical 
activity and mental alertness, and improve appetite and sleep patterns. Many antidepressants 
also are mild sedatives and treat mild forms of depression associated with anxiety. 

The largest class of antidepressants increases the action of neurotransmitters by blocking 
their removal (reuptake) from the synapses (spaces between nerve cells). These drugs 
include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs). Other antidepressants are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which 
increase the length of time neurotransmitters work by blocking monoamine oxidase, an 
enzyme that normally inactivates neurotransmitters. 

Lithium is a drug that is used to stabilize the mood swings and unpredictable behavior of 
people with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). 

Anti-Alzheimer drugs, used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer disease, act by aiding 
brain neurotransmitters (acetylcholine) or shielding brain cells from glutamate, a 
neurotransmitter that at high levels contributes to death of brain cells. Table 21-4 lists 
examples of antidepressants and anti-Alzheimer drugs. 



PHARMACOLOGY 891 


ANTIDIABETICS 

Antidiabetics are used to treat diabetes mellitus (condition in which either the hormone 
insulin is not produced, or the body’s tissues have developed insensitivity to insulin). 
Patients with type 1 diabetes have lost the ability to produce insulin as children or young 
adults and must receive daily injections of insulin. Human insulin and synthetic derivations 
produced by recombinant DNA research have largely replaced animal-derived insulin in the 
management of diabetes. Rapid-acting insulins start working in 15 to 30 minutes and last 
3 to 5 hours. Short-acting insulin begins working within 30 minutes to an hour and lasts 5 
to 8 hours. Long-acting insulins have a time to onset of 1 to 3 hours and last between 24 
and 36 hours. 

Patients with type 2 diabetes usually develop diabetes later in life and have insensitivity 
to insulin. Their disease may be well controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs. These include 
sulfonylureas (lower the levels of glucose in the blood by stimulating the production of 
insulin), biguanides (increase the body’s sensitivity to insulin and reduce the production of 
glucose by the liver), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (temporarily block enzymes that digest 
sugars), thiazolidinediones (enhance glucose uptake into tissues), and meglitinides 
(stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to produce insulin). 

An insulin pump is a device strapped to the patient’s waist that periodically delivers (via 
subcutaneous needle in the abdomen) the desired amount of insulin. 

Table 21-4 lists antidiabetic drugs. 

ANTIHISTAMINES 

These drugs block the action of histamine, which is normally released in the body in allergic 
reactions. Histamine causes allergic symptoms such as hives, bronchial asthma, hay fever, 
and in severe cases, anaphylactic shock (dyspnea, hypotension, and loss of consciousness). 
Antihistamines cannot cure the allergic reaction, but they relieve its symptoms. Many 
antihistamines have strong antiemetic (prevention of nausea) activity and are used to 
prevent motion sickness. The most common side effects of antihistamines are drowsiness, 
blurred vision, tremors, digestive upset, and lack of motor coordination.

ANTIOSTEOPOROSIS DRUGS 

Osteoporosis is a disorder marked by abnormal loss of bone density. Calcium, vitamin D, 
and estrogen are prescribed to increase calcium deposition in bone. Several different drugs 
are used to treat osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates prevent bone loss, and hormone-like drugs 
called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) increase bone formation. See 
Table 21-5. 

CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS 

Cardiovascular drugs act on the heart or the blood vessels to treat hypertension, angina 
(pain due to decreased oxygen delivery to heart muscle), myocardial infarction (heart 
attack), congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias. Often, before other drugs are used, daily 
aspirin therapy (to prevent clots in blood vessels) and sublingual nitroglycerin (to dilate 
coronary blood vessels) are prescribed. Digoxin (Lanoxin) helps the heart pump more 
forcefully in heart failure. Other cardiovascular drugs include: 

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors—dilate blood vessels to lower blood 
pressure, improve the performance of the heart, and reduce its workload. They prevent 
the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, which is a powerful vasopressor 
(vasoconstrictor). ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death 
even if a patient is not hypertensive. 

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)—lower blood pressure by preventing 
angiotensin from acting on receptors in blood vessels. They are used in patients who 
do not tolerate ACE inhibitors because of cough or angioedema (swelling of tissues). 

Antiarrhythmics—reverse abnormal heart rhythms. They slow the response of heart 
muscle to nervous system stimulation or slow the rate at which nervous system 
impulses are carried through the heart. 

Beta-blockers—decrease muscular tone in blood vessels (leading to vasodilation), slow 
heart rate, decrease output of the heart, and reduce blood pressure by blocking the 
action of epinephrine at receptor sites in the heart muscle and in blood vessels. 
Beta-blockers are prescribed for angina, hypertension, arrhythmias (such as 
fibrillation), and prevention of a second heart attack. 

Calcium channel blockers—dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure and are used 
to treat angina and arrhythmias. They inhibit the entry of calcium (necessary for blood 
vessel contraction) into the muscles of the heart and blood vessels. 

Cardiac glycosides—made from digitalis (foxglove plant). These drugs increase the force 
of contraction of the heart and are used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation. 
Cholesterol-binding drugs—bind to dietary cholesterol and prevent its uptake from the 

gastrointestinal tract. 

Cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins)—control hypercholesterolemia (high levels of 
cholesterol in the blood), which is a major factor in the development of heart disease. 
These drugs lower cholesterol by reducing its production in the liver. 

Diuretics—reduce the volume of blood in the body by promoting the kidney to remove 
water and salt through urine. They treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and 
congestive heart failure. 

Table 21-6 gives examples of cardiovascular drugs. 

ENDOCRINE DRUGS

and adrenal glands, are used for male hormone replacement and to treat endometriosis and 
anemia. Antiandrogens interfere with the production of androgens or with their binding in 
tissues. They are prescribed for prostate cancer. Estrogens are female hormones, normally 
produced by the ovaries, that are used for symptoms associated with menopause (estrogen 
replacement therapy) and to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis. Aromatase inhibitors 
also reduce the amount of estrogen (estradiol) in the blood and are effective against breast 
cancer. 

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have estrogen-like effects on bone 
(increase in bone density) and on lipid metabolism (decrease in cholesterol levels). 
However, they lack estrogenic effects on uterus and breast tissue. SERMs are used to treat 
postmenopausal osteoporosis and breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are SERMs. 
Progestins are prescribed for abnormal uterine bleeding caused by hormonal imbalance 
and, together with estrogen, in hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives. 

Thyroid hormone is administered when there is a low output of hormone from the 
thyroid gland. Calcitonin (a thyroid hormone) is used to treat osteoporosis. It increases 
calcium in the blood and promotes bone deposition.Glucocorticoids(adrenal corticosteroids) 
are prescribed for reduction of inflammation and a wide range of other disorders, including 
arthritis, severe skin and allergic conditions, respiratory and blood disorders, gastrointestinal 
ailments, and malignant conditions. 

A fragment of human parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been approved for osteoporosis 
treatment. This agent stimulates new bone formation. Growth hormone release–inhibiting 
factor (somatostatin) can be manufactured and given to treat gastrointestinal symptoms 
associated with acromegaly and other tumors. It inhibits the production of natural growth 
hormone.

Gastrointestinal drugs often are used to relieve uncomfortable and potentially dangerous 
symptoms, rather than as cures for specific diseases. Antacids neutralize the hydrochloric 
acid in the stomach to relieve symptoms of peptic ulcer, esophagitis, and reflux. Antiulcer 
drugs block secretion of acid by cells in the lining of the stomach and are prescribed for 
patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
Histamine H2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine (Zantac) and cimetidine (Tagamet) 
turn off histamine, which promotes secretion of stomach acid. Another drug, omeprazole 
(Prilosec), works by stopping acid production by a different method (proton pump 
inhibition). 

Antidiarrheal drugs relieve diarrhea and decrease the rapid movement (peristalsis) in the 
muscular walls of the colon. Cathartics relieve constipation and promote defecation for 
diagnostic and operative procedures and are used to treat disorders of the gastrointestinal 
tract. Some cathartics increase the intestinal salt content to cause fluid to fill the intestines; 
others increase the bulk of the feces to promote peristalsis. Another type of cathartic 
lubricates the intestinal tract to produce soft stools. Laxatives are mild cathartics, and 
purgatives are strong cathartics. 

Antinauseants (antiemetics) relieve nausea and vomiting and overcome vertigo, 
dizziness, motion sickness, and similar symptoms due to labyrinthitis (inflammation of the 
inner ear). 

Anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) drugs are used to treat autoimmune diseases such as 
Crohn’s. These drugs are also used against rheumatoid arthritis.

Respiratory drugs are prescribed for the treatment of asthma, emphysema, chronic 
bronchitis, and bronchospasm. Bronchodilators open bronchial tubes and are administered 
by injection or aerosol inhalers. Steroid drugs are inhaled or given intravenously and orally 
to reduce chronic inflammation in respiratory passageways. Leukotriene modifiers are 
recent additions to the anti-inflammatory therapy of asthma. They prevent asthma attacks 
by blocking leukotriene (a bronchoconstrictor) from binding to receptors in respiratory 
tissues. Table 21-9 gives examples of respiratory drugs.

SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS 

Sedative-hypnotics are medications that depress the central nervous system and promote 
drowsiness (sedatives) and sleep (hypnotics). They are prescribed for insomnia and sleep 
disorders. These products have a very high abuse potential and should be used only for 
short periods of time and under close supervision. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are 
the two major categories of sedative-hypnotics. 

Low doses of benzodiazepines (which influence the part of the brain responsible for 
emotions) may act as sedatives. In higher doses, benzodiazepines may act as hypnotics (to 
promote sleep). 

Table 21-10 gives examples of sedative-hypnotics. 

STIMULANTS 

Stimulants are drugs that act on the brain to speed up vital processes (heart and respiration) 
in cases of shock and collapse. They also increase alertness and inhibit hyperactive behavior 
in children. High doses can produce restlessness, insomnia, and hypertension. Examples of 
stimulants are amphetamines—used to prevent narcolepsy (seizures of sleep), to suppress 
appetite, and to calm hyperkinetic children. Caffeine also is a cerebral stimulant. It is used 
in drugs to relieve certain types of headache by constricting cerebral blood vessels. Table 
21-10 lists examples of stimulants. 

TRANQUILIZERS 

Tranquilizers are useful for controlling anxiety. Minor tranquilizers (benzodiazepines) 
control minor symptoms of anxiety. Major tranquilizers (phenothiazines) control more 
severe disturbances of behavior. Table 21-10 lists examples of minor and major tranquilizers.

922 PSYCHIATRY 


22 
INTRODUCTION 

You will find this chapter different from others in the book. Some, but not all, psychiatric 
disorders are not readily explainable in terms of abnormalities in the structure or chemistry 
of an organ or tissue, as are other illnesses. In addition, the causes of mental disorders are 
complex and include significant psychological and social as well as chemical and structural 
elements. This chapter provides a simple outline of psychiatric disorders and definitions of 
major psychiatric terms. For more extensive and detailed information, you may wish to 
consult the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text 
revision (DSM-IV-TR), published by the American Psychiatric Association (Washington, 
DC), as well as other textbooks of psychiatry. 

Psychiatry (psych/o = mind, iatr/o = treatment) is the branch of medicine that deals 
with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illness. It is a specialty of clinical 
medicine like surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics. 

Psychiatrists complete the same medical training (4 years of medical school) as for other 
physicians and receive an MD (doctor of medicine) degree. Then they spend a variable 
number of years training in the methods and practice of psychotherapy (psychological 
techniques for treating mental disorders) and psychopharmacology (drug therapy). 
Psychiatrists complete 4 years of residency training and then extra years of fellowship 
training to specialize in various aspects of psychiatry. Child psychiatrists specialize in the 
treatment of children; forensic psychiatrists specialize in the legal aspects of psychiatry, 
such as the determination of mental competence in criminal cases. Psychoanalysts 
complete 3 to 5 additional years of training in a special psychotherapeutic technique called 
psychoanalysis in which the patient freely relates her or his thoughts and associations 
to the analyst, who does not interfere with the process. Interpretations are offered at 
appropriate times. 

A psychologist is a nonmedical professional who is trained in methods of psychological 
testing, psychotherapy, analysis, and research and completes a doctor of philosophy (PhD) 
or doctor of education (EdD) degree program in a specific field of interest, such as clinical 
(patient-oriented) psychology, experimental research, or social psychology (focusing on 
social interaction and the ways the actions of others influence the behavior of the individual). 
A clinical psychologist, like a psychiatrist, can use various methods of psychotherapy to 
treat patients but, unlike a psychiatrist, cannot prescribe drugs or electroconvulsive 
therapy. Other nonphysicians trained in the treatment of mental illness include licensed 
clinical social workers, psychiatric nurses, and licensed mental health clinicians (LMHCs). 

Clinical psychologists are trained in the use of tests to evaluate various aspects of a 
patient’s mental health and intelligence. Examples are intelligence (IQ) tests such as the 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. Two 
projective (personality) tests are the use of Rorschach technique, in which inkblots, as 
shown in Figure 22-1, are used to bring out associations, and the Thematic Apperception 
Test (TAT), in which pictures are used as stimuli for making up stories (Figure 22-2). Both 
tests are revealing of personality structure. Examples of graphomotor projection tests are 
the Draw a Person Test, in which the patient is asked to copy a body, and the Bender-
Gestalt Test, in which the patient is asked to draw certain geometric designs. The Bender-
Gestalt Test picks up deficits in mental processing and memory caused by brain damage and 
is used to screen children for developmental delays. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory (MMPI) contains true-false questions that reveal aspects of personality, such as 
sense of duty or responsibility, ability to relate to others, and dominance (assertiveness, 
resourcefulness). This test is widely used as a measure of psychological health in adolescents 
and adults. The patient’s responses to questions are compared with responses made by 
patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, depression, and so on.

PSYCHIATRIC CLINICAL SYMPTOMS 

The following terms describe abnormalities that are evident to an examining mental health professional. 
Familiarity with these terms will help you understand the next section, Psychiatric Disorders. 

amnesia Loss of memory. 
anxiety Varying degrees of uneasiness, apprehension, or dread often accompanied 
by palpitations, tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and choking 
sensations. 
apathy Absence of emotions; lack of interest, emotional involvement, or 
motivation. 
compulsion Uncontrollable urge to perform an act repeatedly. 
conversion Anxiety becomes a bodily symptom, such as blindness, deafness, or 
paralysis, that does not have a physical basis.

924 PSYCHIATRY 
delusion A fixed, false belief that cannot be changed by logical reasoning or 
evidence. 
dissociation Uncomfortable feelings are separated from their real object. In order to 
avoid mental distress, the feelings are redirected toward a second object 
or behavior pattern. 
dysphoria Sadness, hopelessness; depressive mood, or feeling “low.” 
euphoria Exaggerated feeling of well-being (“high”). 
hallucination False or unreal sensory perception as, for example, hearing voices when 
none are present; an illusion is a false perception of an actual sensory 
stimulus. 
labile Variable; undergoing rapid emotional change. 
mania Elation or irritability, associated with distractibility, hyperactivity, 
talkativeness, injudicious acts, flight of ideas, and racing thoughts. 
mutism Non-reactive state with inability to speak. 
obsession An involuntary, persistent idea or emotion; the suffix -mania indicates 
a strong obsession with something (e.g., pyromania is an obsession 
with fire). 
paranoia Overly suspicious system of thinking; fixed delusion that one is being 
harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated. 

PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS 

Sigmund Freud’s ideas of personality structure play an important role in the understanding 
of many types of psychiatric disorders. Freud believed that personality is made up of three 
major parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id represents the unconscious instincts 
and psychic energy present from birth. The id contains basic drives that, operating according 
to the pleasure principle, seek immediate gratification regardless of the reality of the 
situation. 

The ego is the central coordinating branch of the personality. It is the mediator between 
the id and the outside world. It is the part of the personality that evaluates and assesses the 
reality of a situation (reality testing) and, if necessary, postpones the gratification of a need 
or drive (id) until a satisfactory object or situation arises. The ego is perceived as being 
“self ” by the individual. 

The superego is the internalized conscience and moral part of the personality. It 
encompasses the sense of discipline derived from parental authority and society. Guilt 
feelings, for example, arise from behavior and thoughts that do not conform to the standards 
of the superego. 

Freud believed that certain psychological disorders occur when conflicts arise between 
two or more of these aspects of the personality. Defense mechanisms, such as denial, 
are techniques people use to ward off the anxiety produced by these conflicts. For example, 
a person afflicted with a serious illness may avoid confronting his or her present or 
future problems by denial. Thus, he or she may refuse to believe the diagnosis, may miss 
appointments, may neglect medication, or may ignore symptoms. All individuals use 
defense mechanisms to cope with difficult problems. The use of these mechanisms may be 
regarded as abnormal or normal according to whether that use makes a constructive or 
destructive contribution to the individual’s personality. 



PSYCHIATRY 925 


The term psychosis is frequently used to describe mental illness. A psychosis involves 
significant impairment of reality testing, with symptoms such as delusions (false beliefs), 
hallucinations (false sensory perceptions), and bizarre behavior. Schizophrenic disorders 
are examples of psychoses. Patients exhibit a disturbed sense of self, inappropriate affect 
(emotional reactions), and withdrawal from the external world. 

Psychiatric disorders that are discussed in this section are anxiety disorders, delirium 
and dementia, dissociative disorders, eating disorders, mood disorders, personality 
disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenia, sexual and gender identity 
disorders, somatoform disorders, and substance-related disorders. 

ANXIETY DISORDERS 

Anxiety disorders are characterized by the experience of unpleasant tension, distress, 
troubled feelings, and avoidance behavior. A panic attack is a defined period of intense fear 
or discomfort in which symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. 
Symptoms and clinical signs may include the following: 

. Palpitations 
. Sweating 
. Trembling 
. Smothering or shortness of breath 
. Feeling of choking 
. Chest pain 
. Nausea 
. Feeling dizzy or faint 
. Feelings of unreality or depersonalization 
. Fear of losing control or going crazy 
. Fear of dying 
. Numbness or tingling 
. Hot flashes 
Panic disorder is a condition characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and 
persistent concern about having another panic attack in between episodes. A panic attack 
can occur in the context of other anxiety disorders, such as phobic, obsessive-compulsive, 
post-traumatic stress, and generalized anxiety disorders. 
Phobic disorders are characterized by irrational or debilitating fears associated with a 
specific object or situation. The patient with a phobic disorder goes to extreme lengths to 
avoid the object of her or his fear. The object that is feared often is symbolic of an unconscious 
conflict that is the cause of the phobia and thus diverts the patient’s attention from the 
conflict, keeping it unconscious. Panic attacks (periods of intense apprehension and fear) 
can occur in anticipation of the phobic situation. 
Agoraphobia (agora-= marketplace) is the fear of being in open, crowded, public places 
from which escape would be difficult or in which help might not be available, or of going 
out alone in “unsafe” places. Persons with agoraphobia limit their normal activities to avoid 
situations that trigger their anxiety. Thus, they may feel comfortable only when at home or 
in the company of a friend or relative. 
A social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the fear of situations in which the affected 
person is open to public scrutiny, which could result in possible embarrassment and 
humiliation. For example, the fear may focus on speaking in public, using public lavatories, 
or eating in public. 
Other specific phobias are claustrophobia (fear of closed-in places; claustr/o = barrier), 
acrophobia (fear of heights; in this term, acr/o = a high point), and zoophobia (fear of 
animals; zo/o = animals). 

22 


926 PSYCHIATRY 


22 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) involves recurrent thoughts (obsessions) and 
repetitive acts (compulsions) that dominate the patient’s life. The patient experiences 
anxiety if he or she is prevented from performing special rituals. Often the OCD consumes 
time and interferes with the individual’s social or occupational functioning. Several 
antidepressant drugs, including clomipramine, have been used to treat OCD, with 
considerable success, particularly when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of symptoms (intense fear, 
helplessness, insomnia, nightmares, and diminished responsiveness to the external world) 
following exposure to a traumatic event. Flashbacks, bothersome thoughts, and anxiety 
often triggered by reminders occur in episodes long after a life-threatening or major 
emotional event. People avoid situations with reminders. Many survivors of the September 
11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon experienced post-
traumatic stress disorder. 

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic anxiety and exaggerated 
worry and tension even when there is little or nothing to provoke such feelings. 

DELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA 

Delirium and dementia are disorders of cognition (mental processes of thinking, perception, 
reasoning, and judgment). 

Delirium is an acute, temporary disturbance of consciousness characterized by mental 
confusion and often psychotic symptoms. The affected person usually presents with 
rambling, irrelevant, or incoherent speech, sensory misperceptions, and disorientation as 
to time, place, or person and with memory impairment. Delirium is caused by a variety of 
conditions, including drug intoxication or withdrawal, seizures or head trauma, and 
metabolic disturbances such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, or hepatic 
or renal failure. Delirium tremens is brought on by stopping alcohol consumption suddenly 
after prolonged periods of heavy alcohol ingestion. 

Dementia is impairment of judgment, memory, and abstract thinking that involves a 
general, more gradual loss of intellectual abilities as well as changes in personality. It also 
includes difficulty with language and with simple acts like dressing or brushing the teeth. 
Dementia may be caused by conditions, some reversible and some progressive, involving 
damage to the brain. The most common cause is Alzheimer disease, but other causes are 
cerebrovascular disease (stroke), central nervous system (CNS) infection, medications and 
drugs, brain trauma, tumors, and Parkinson and Huntington diseases. Depression also can 
manifest as (pseudo)dementia. It is important to identify treatable causes of dementia. 

DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER 

A dissociative disorder is a condition involving breakdown in memory, identity, or 
perception. People with dissociative disorder escape reality through amnesia, fugue (sudden 
travel away from home or work), or alternate identities. 

EATING DISORDERS 

Eating disorders are severe disturbances in eating behavior. Examples are anorexia nervosa 
and bulimia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by refusal to maintain a minimal 
normal body weight. The affected person is intensely afraid of gaining weight and has a 
disturbance in perception of the shape or size of her or his body. (The term anorexia, 



PSYCHIATRY 927 


meaning “lack of appetite,” is a misnomer because lack of appetite is rare.) The condition 
predominantly affects adolescent females, and its principal symptom is a conscious, 
relentless attempt to diet along with excessive, compulsive overactivity, such as exercise, 
running, or gymnastics. Most postmenarchal females with this disorder are amenorrheic. 

Bulimia nervosa (bulimia means abnormal increase in hunger) is characterized by binge 
eating (uncontrolled indulgence in food) followed by purging (eliminating food from the 
body). Persons with bulimia maintain normal or nearly normal weight because after 
bingeing they engage in inappropriate purging. Examples of purging are self-induced 
vomiting and the misuse of laxatives or enemas. 

MOOD DISORDERS 

A mood disorder is a condition of prolonged, intense abnormal mood, like sadness, that 
dominates the patient’s entire mental life for some time. Examples of mood disorders are 
bipolar disorder and depressive disorder. 

Bipolar disorders (bi-= two; pol/o = extreme) are characterized by one or more manic 
episodes alternating with depressive episodes. A manic episode is a period during which the 
predominant mood is excessively elevated (euphoria), expansive, or irritable. Associated 
symptoms include inflated self-esteem, or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, a nearly 
continuous flow of rapid speech with quick changes of topic, distractibility, an increase in 
goal-directed activity, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high 
potential for painful consequences. Often there are increased sociability and participation 
in multiple activities marked by intrusive, domineering, and demanding behavior. 
Hypomania (in this term, hypo-= decrease) describes a mood resembling mania, but of 
lesser intensity. Bipolar disorder I is characterized by one or more manic episodes, often 
alternating with major depressive episodes. Bipolar disorder II is characterized by recurrent 
major depressive episodes alternating with hypomanic episodes. 

Cyclothymic disorder (cycl/o = cycle, thym/o = mind) is a mild form of bipolar disorder 
characterized by at least 2 years of hypomania and numerous depressive episodes that do 
not meet the criteria that define a major depressive episode. 

Depressive disorders are marked by the occurrence of one or more major depressive 
episodes without a history of mania or hypomania. Major depression involves episodes 
of severe dysphoria (sadness, hopelessness, worry, discouragement). Other signs and 
symptoms are appetite disturbances (increase or decrease) and changes in weight; sleep 
disorders such as insomnia or hypersomnia; fatigue or low energy; feelings of worthlessness, 
hopelessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt; difficulty thinking or concentrating; and 
recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Dysthymia (or dysthymic disorder) is a depressive 
disorder involving depressed mood (feeling sad or “down in the dumps”) that persists over 
a 2-year period but is not as severe as major depression. Also, there are no psychotic features 
(delusions, hallucinations, incoherent thinking) as are sometimes found in major 
depression. 

Researchers have noted a relationship between the onset of an episode of depressive 
disorder and a particular period of the year. A regular appearance of depression may occur 
within approximately 60 days, between the beginning of October and the end of November, 
every year. This is referred to as seasonal affective (mood) disorder (SAD). A change from 
depression to mania or hypomania also may occur within a 60-day period from mid-
February to mid-April.

928 PSYCHIATRY 

PERSONALITY DISORDERS 

Personality traits are established patterns of thinking and ways of relating to and perceiving the environment 
and the self; however, when these traits become inflexible and rigid or are the source of impaired functioning, 
distress, and conflict with others, they constitute personality disorders. Types of personality disorders include 

the following: 
antisocial No loyalty to or concern for others, and without moral standards; acts 
only in response to desires and impulses; cannot tolerate frustration and 
blames others when he or she is at fault. 
borderline Instability in interpersonal relationships and sense of self; characterized 
by alternating involvement with and rejection of people. Frantic efforts 
are made to avoid real or imagined abandonment. 
histrionic Emotional, attention-seeking, immature, and dependent; irrational 
outbursts and tantrums; flamboyant and theatrical; having general 
dissatisfaction with the self and angry feelings about the world. 
narcissistic Grandiose sense of self-importance or uniqueness and preoccupation with 
fantasies of success and power. Narcissism is a pervasive interest in the 
self with a lack of empathy for others. 
paranoid Continually suspicious and mistrustful of other people but not to a 
psychotic or delusional degree; jealous and overly concerned with hidden 
motives of others; quick to take offense. 
schizoid Emotionally cold and aloof; indifferent to praise or criticism or to the 
feelings of others; few friendships and rarely appears to experience strong 
emotions, such as anger or joy. 

PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS 

Pervasive developmental disorders are a group of childhood disorders characterized by delays in the 
development of socialization and communication skills. Examples are autism and Asperger syndrome. 
Autism, commonly becoming evident during the first 3 years of life, is marked by difficulties in verbal and 
nonverbal communication and in social and play interactions. It is a spectrum disorder, affecting each 
individual differently and at varying degrees. Persons with autism may exhibit some of the following traits: 

. Resistance to change; insistence on sameness 
. Using gestures or pointing instead of words to communicate needs 
. Repeating words or phrases 
. Preference for being alone; aloof in manner 
. Tantrums 
. Difficulty in interacting with others 
. Not wanting to be touched 
. Little or no eye contact 
. Uneven gross/fine motor skills 
. Sensitivity to sound 
. Obsessive attachment to objects 
Symptoms of autism may lessen as the child develops and receives treatment. See the In Person feature on 
page 943. 

Asperger syndrome is often referred to as a less severe type of autism. Children with Asperger syndrome 
frequently have normal language skills and normal intelligence. They usually want to interact with others but 
don’t know how to do it. They may have fine rote memory skills but have difficulty with abstract concepts. 
Repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior may also be part of the picture.

SCHIZOPHRENIA 

Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder characterized by disturbed thinking and disorganized speech. It 
includes the following symptoms: 

Delusions such as “people are out to get me” or thought broadcasting (belief that internal thoughts are 

broadcast to the external world so that others can hear them). 
Hallucinations involving voices or sounds that do not exist but seem real. 
Thought disorder, such as loosening of associations (ideas shift from one subject to another, completely 

unrelated or only obliquely connected). This may result in incoherent, incomprehensible speech. 
Disorders of movement, including involuntary movements and mannerisms or clumsiness or 
uncoordination. 

Flat affect marked by monotonous voice, immobile face, and no signs of expression. Affect (external 
expression of emotion) also may be inappropriate (smiling and laughing when the subject is serious). 
Impaired interpersonal functioning and relationship to the external world, such as emotional detachment 

and social withdrawal. 
Positive symptoms of schizophrenia are thought disorder, hallucinations, and delusions. Negative symptoms 
include flat affect (apathy), social withdrawal, and inability to experience pleasure. 

Psychiatrists describe subtypes types of schizophrenia, such as catatonic type (the patient is mute and does 
not move or react to the outside environment); disorganized type (the patient exhibits disorganized speech 
and bizarre behavior); and paranoid type (the patient experiences prominent delusions of grandeur or 
persecution and auditory hallucinations). 

SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS 

Sexual disorders are divided into two types: paraphilias and sexual dysfunctions. Paraphilias (para-= 
abnormal, -philia = attraction to or love) are characterized by recurrent intense sexual urges, fantasies, or 
behaviors that involve unusual objects, activities, or situations. Sexual dysfunctions are disturbances in 
sexual desire or changes in sexual response, such as premature ejaculation and dyspareunia (painful sexual 
intercourse) that are not the result of a general medical condition. 

Examples of paraphilias are: 
exhibitionism Compulsive need to expose one’s body, particularly the genitals, to an 
unsuspecting stranger. 
fetishism The use of nonliving objects (articles of clothing) as substitutes for a 
human sexual love object. 
pedophilia Sexual urges and fantasies involving sexual activity with a prepubescent 
child (age 13 or younger). 
sexual masochism Sexual gratification is gained by being humiliated, beaten, bound, or 
otherwise made to suffer by another person. 
sexual sadism Sexual gratification is gained by inflicting physical or psychological pain 
or humiliation on others. 
transvestic fetishism Cross-dressing; wearing clothing of the opposite sex. This disorder has 
been described in heterosexual males who have intense sexually arousing 
fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving cross-dressing. 
voyeurism Sexual excitement is achieved by observing unsuspecting people who are 
naked, undressing, or engaging in sexual activity.

22 
A gender identity disorder is likely to be reclassified as gender dysphoria in the next 
edition of the DSM. In DSM-IV-TR, this condition is defined as a strong and persistent 
cross-gender identification with the opposite sex manifested in preference for cross-dressing 
and cross-gender roles in make-believe play or in persistent fantasies of being the other sex. 

SOMATOFORM DISORDERS 

In somatoform disorders, the patient’s mental conflicts are expressed as physical symptoms. 
The physical signs and symptoms, such as abdominal or chest pain, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, palpitations, deafness, blindness, and paralysis, are not adequately explained by a 
physical or other mental disorder or by injury and are not side effects of medication, drugs, 
or alcohol. There is no diagnosable medical condition such as depression that fully accounts 
for a physical symptom. 

Examples of somatoform (somat/o = body) disorders are conversion disorder and 
hypochondriasis. 

Conversion disorder is a loss of physical functioning that suggests a physical disorder 
but that instead is an expression of a psychological conflict or need. The patient usually 
has a feared or unconscious conflict that threatens to escape from repression (a defense 
mechanism in which a person removes unacceptable ideas or impulses from consciousness), 
but the energies associated with this conflict are experienced as a physical symptom. 
The conversion symptom (examples are paralysis, blindness, seizures, paresthesias, and 
dyskinesia) enables the affected person to avoid the conflict and get support from the 
surrounding environment. For example, a person with repressed anger and desire to 
physically harm a family member may suddenly develop paralysis of the arm (conversion 
symptom). Another example of a conversion symptom might be paralysis of the finger used 
to pull the trigger of a gun if there was internal conflict about firing the weapon. 

Hypochondriasis is a preoccupation with body aches, pains, and discomforts in the 
absence of real illness. Appropriate physical evaluation and diagnostic testing do not support 
the diagnosis of any physical disorder that can account for the symptoms or the person’s 
interpretation of them. Ruling out a physical abnormality does not reassure the person 
with hypochondriasis. 

SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS 

Substance-related disorders are characterized by symptoms and behavioral changes 
associated with regular use or discontinuation of substances that affect the central nervous 
system. Continued or periodic use of certain drugs produces a state of dependence. 
Psychological dependence is a compulsion to continue taking a drug despite adverse 
consequences, and physiologic dependence is characterized by the onset of withdrawal 
symptoms when the drug is discontinued abruptly. A significant feature of physiologic 
dependence is tolerance. Tolerance is the declining effect of the drug so that the dose must 
be increased to give the same effect. 

Examples of substances that are associated with drug abuse (use of a drug for purposes 
other than those for which it is prescribed) and dependence are: 

Alcohol. Alcohol dependence often is associated with the use and abuse of other 
psychoactive drugs (cannabis, cocaine, heroin, amphetamines). Signs of alcohol 
dependence and intoxication include slurred speech, incoordination, unsteady gait, 
nystagmus (rapid, rhythmic movement of the eyeball), impairment in attention or 
memory, stupor, or coma. It also is associated with depression, as either a cause or a 
consequence of the drinking. 



PSYCHIATRY 931 


Amphetamines. These central nervous system stimulants are taken orally or 
administered intravenously. Examples are amphetamine (Benzedrine), dextroamphetamine 
(Dexedrine), methamphetamine (Desoxyn, or “speed”), and methylphenidate (Ritalin). 
Some appetite suppressants (diet pills) are amphetamine-like drugs. Psychological and 
behavioral changes associated with amphetamine dependence include anger, tension or 
anxiety, impaired judgment, inability to enjoy what was previously pleasurable, and social 
isolation. Physical signs and symptoms include tachycardia or bradycardia, pupillary 
dilation, nausea, elevated or low blood pressure, and muscular weakness. Serious depression 
can occur during withdrawal. 

Cannabis. This class of drugs includes all substances with psychoactive properties 
derived from the cannabis plant plus chemically similar synthetic substances. Examples 
are marijuana, hashish, and purified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major 
psychoactive ingredient in these substances. Psychological and physical signs and symptoms 
after the smoking of cannabis include euphoria, impaired motor coordination, anxiety, 
sensation of slowed time, social withdrawal, and impaired memory and judgment. Other 
signs of cannabis intoxication are increased appetite, dry mouth, tachycardia, and paranoia. 

Cocaine. Cocaine is a stimulant drug that produces euphoria as well as vasoconstriction, 
tachycardia, and hypertension. It comes from the leaves of the coca tree that grows in 
Central and South America. The form of cocaine most commonly used in the United States 
is cocaine hydrochloride powder, which is inhaled through the nostrils and then absorbed 
into the bloodstream through mucous membranes. It also can be injected intravenously, 
either alone or mixed with heroin (speedball). This mixture is particularly dangerous 
because cocaine and heroin act synergistically to depress respiratory function. If the cocaine 
is separated from its powdered salt form and combined with ether, ammonia, or baking 
soda, the resulting cocaine alkaloid is commonly called freebase. This form can be smoked 
and is known as crack or rock. Often, the user of cocaine also is dependent on alcohol or 
sedatives, which are taken in an attempt to alleviate the unpleasant aftereffects (anxiety, 
depression, and fatigue) of cocaine intoxication. 

Hallucinogens. These drugs produce a state of central nervous system excitement, 
hyperactivity, hallucinations, delusions, hypertension, and mood changes. Examples of 
hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline (peyote), and phencyclidine 
(PCP). The use of hallucinogens generally is episodic because their psychoactive effects are 
highly potent; frequent use may lead to marked tolerance. 

Opioids. This group of drugs includes heroin and morphine and synthetic drugs with 
morphine-like action, such as codeine, meperidine (Demerol), and oxycodone (OxyContin 
is sustained-release oxycodone). These compounds are prescribed as analgesics (painkillers), 
anesthetics, or cough suppressants. Typical signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication are 
pupillary constriction, euphoria, slowness in movement, drowsiness, and slurred speech. 
Effects of overdose are slow and shallow breathing, convulsions, coma, and possible death. 
Signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal are watery eyes, rhinorrhea (runny nose), 
pupillary dilation, abdominal cramps and diarrhea, and muscle and joint pain. 

Sedatives, Hypnotics, or Anxiolytics. These drugs have a soothing, relaxing, euphoric 
effect and also can produce sleep (hypnotics). Sleeping pills include barbiturates such as 
phenobarbital and secobarbital. Other drugs that produce a barbiturate-like effect are 
benzodiazepines, including temazepam (Restoril), clonazepam (Klonopin), alprazolam 
(Xanax), and diazepam (Valium). Intoxication is characterized by slurred speech and 
disorientation. Effects of overdose are shallow respiration, cold and clammy skin, dilated 
pupils, weak and rapid pulse, coma, and possibly death. Sudden cessation of these drugs can 
result in seizures.

THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES 

Some major therapeutic techniques that are used to treat psychiatric disorders are 
psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and drug therapy (psychopharmacology). 

PSYCHOTHERAPY 

Psychotherapy is the treatment of emotional problems and disorders using psychological 
techniques. The following are psychotherapeutic techniques used by psychiatrists, 
psychologists, and other mental health professionals. 

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This is a relatively short-term, focused psychotherapy 
for a wide range of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, anger, marital 
conflict, fears, and substance abuse. The focus is on how the person who is experiencing 
difficulty is thinking, behaving, and communicating today, rather than on early childhood 
experiences. Because CBT is based on the idea that thoughts cause feelings and behaviors 
(not people, situations, or events), if the person can change established ways of thinking, 
then he or she can feel better even if the situation does not change. CBT techniques often 
are used to lower anxiety. 

Family Therapy. Treatment of an entire family can help the members resolve and understand 
their conflicts and problems. 

Group Therapy. In a group with a mental health professional leader as a neutral moderator, 
patients with similar problems gain insight into their own personalities through discussions 
and interaction with each other. In psychodrama, patients express their feelings by acting 
out family and social roles along with other patient-actors on a stage. After a scene has been 
presented, the audience (composed of other patients) is asked to make comments and offer 
interpretations about what they have observed. 

Hypnosis. A trance (state of altered consciousness) is created to help in recovery of deeply 
repressed memories. Hypnotic techniques are also used for anxiety reduction, creating a 
sense of psychological safety and for problem solving. 

Insight-Oriented Psychotherapy. This type of psychotherapy uses face-to-face discussion of 
life problems and associated feelings. The aim is to increase understanding of underlying 
conflicts, themes, thoughts, and behavior patterns to improve mood (depressive feelings). 

Play Therapy. In this form of therapy, the child uses play with toys to express conflicts and 
feelings that he or she is unable to communicate in a direct manner. 

Psychoanalysis. This long-term and intense form of psychotherapy seeks to influence 
behavior and resolve internal conflicts by allowing patients to bring their unconscious 
emotions to the surface. Through techniques such as free association (the patient speaks 
his or her thoughts one after another without censorship), transference (the patient relates 
to the therapist as to a person who figured prominently in early childhood, such as a parent 
or sibling), and dream interpretation, the patient is able to bring unconscious emotional 
conflicts to awareness and thus can overcome these problems. 

Sex Therapy. This form of therapy can help people overcome sexual dysfunctions such as 
frigidity (inhibited sexual response in women), impotence (inability of a man to achieve 
and/or maintain an erection), and premature ejaculation (release of semen before coitus 
can be achieved). 

Supportive Psychotherapy. The therapist offers encouragement, support, and hope to 
patients facing difficult life transitions and events. 

22 


934 PSYCHIATRY 


22 
ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY 

In electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an electrical current is applied to the brain (usually to 
one hemisphere) while the patient is anesthetized, with assisted ventilation. Actual physical 
convulsions are imperceptible. This therapy is used chiefly for serious depression and 
the depressive phase of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder. With the introduction of 
antidepressant drugs, there are fewer indications for electroconvulsive therapy, although it 
can be life-saving when a rapid response is needed. 

DRUG THERAPY 

The following are categories of drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders. Figure 22-4 reviews 
these groups and lists specific drugs in each category. 

. Antianxiety and antipanic agents. These drugs lessen anxiety, tension, and agitation, 
especially when they are associated with panic attacks. Examples are benzodiazepines 
(BZDs), which act as antianxiety agents, sedatives, or anticonvulsants (clonazepam). 
Benzodiazepines directly affect the brain to slow down the transmission of nerve 
impulses. Other antianxiety and antipanic agents are selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs).These agents prevent the reuptake of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) 
into nerve endings, allowing it to linger in the space between it and the next nerve cell. 
. Antidepressants. These drugs gradually reverse depressive symptoms and return the 
patient to a more even state, with less persistent and less severe depressive symptoms. 
The basis of depression is thought to be an imbalance in the levels of neurotransmitters 
in the brain. Several groups of drugs are used as antidepressants. These include: 
1. 
SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as fluoxetine (Prozac). They 
improve mood, mental concentration, physical activity, and sleep patterns. 
2. 
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These drugs suppress an enzyme, 
monoamine oxidase, that normally degrades neurotransmitters. MAO inhibitors 
are not as widely prescribed as other antidepressants because serious cardiovascular 
and liver complications can occur with their use. 
3. 
Tricyclic antidepressants. These drugs contain three fused rings (tricyclic) in their 
chemical structure. They block the reuptake of neurotransmitters at nerve endings. 
Tetracyclic antidepressants such as mirtazapine (Remeron) are also used to treat 
depression symptoms. 
4. 
Atypical antidepressants. These are antidepressants that do not fit in the 
previous categories. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are 
antidepressant drugs that increase the levels of the two neurotransmitters serotonin 
and norepinephrine in the brain. Examples are venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine 
(Pristiq), and duloxetine (Cymbalta). 
. Anti–obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) agents. These drugs are prescribed to 
relieve the symptoms of OCD. Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs are examples of 
these agents. 
. Antipsychotics 
(neuroleptics). These drugs modify psychotic symptoms and 
behavior. Atypical antipsychotics are the major examples. They are used to treat 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental illness. They reduce the anxiety, 
tension, agitation, and aggressiveness associated with psychoses and modify 
psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Other drugs, such as 
phenothiazines and haloperidol (Haldol), are still used as well. An important 
potential adverse effect of taking neuroleptic drugs is tardive dyskinesia (TD); 
tardive means late and dyskinesias are abnormal movements. This is a potentially 
irreversible condition marked by involuntary movements. Early detection is 
important. The AIMS (abnormal involuntary movement scale) is used to monitor

patients for signs of TD. Weight gain and increased risk for developing diabetes also 
are important side effects of atypical antipsychotics. 

. Hypnotics. 
These drugs are used to produce sleep (hypn/o = sleep) and relieve 
insomnia. Examples are sedatives and benzodiazepines. 
. Mood stabilizers. These drugs are used primarily to treat patients with the mania-
predominant forms of bipolar disease. Lithium (Eskalith, Lithane) is commonly used 
to reduce the levels of manic symptoms, such as rapid speech, hyperactive movements, 
grandiose ideas, agitation and irritability, and decreased need for sleep. It also is used 
as an adjunct in the treatment of depression. Lithium is a simple salt that is thought 
to stabilize nerve membranes. Anticonvulsant drugs also are used as mood stabilizers. 
. Stimulants. 
These drugs (amphetamines) are prescribed for attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Common manifestations of ADHD are a 
short attention span and easy distractibility, emotional unstability, impulsivity, and 
moderate to severe hyperactivity.

IN PERSON: LIVING WITH AUTISM 
The following feature was written by the mother of a young boy diagnosed with autism. 

“What you do from now on will determine whether your son will be able to live on his own as an adult or 

whether he will have to live in a facility.” 

I was told this by a physician when my son, Jeff, was diagnosed with autism. 

It began early on. For the first year of his life Jeff had difficulty tolerating many situations and often cried. 
Loud noises such as barking dogs, motorcycles, and the trash truck sent him into a crying frenzy. If he was in 
a quiet room, in a swing or being held he was comfortable. Most other situations he could only tolerate for 
60-90 minutes after which he would cry for 20-30 minutes as if relieving stress. As Jeff aged his tolerance 
slowly increased but even at four years old overstimulation caused him to cry daily. 

Jeff experienced numerous other challenges as well. His ability to play was impaired. If a toy did not light 
up or play music he was not interested in it. The exception was Matchbox cars, which he did enjoy. However, 
he did not play with them appropriately. He merely lined them up. Jeff never engaged in imaginative play nor 
could he carry on a back-and-forth conversation. His speech was rote and he had extreme difficulty 
communicating and relating to peers. 

After visiting several doctors in search of a diagnosis, we were told Jeff was autistic. We also learned that his 
discomfort and crying were a result of sensory integration challenges that children on the autism spectrum 
experience. Sensory integration is the process of organizing useful perceptions, emotions and thoughts. When 
sensory integration is whole and balanced, body movements are highly adaptive and good behavior is a natural 
outcome. This was not the case with Jeff. 

It was difficult to accept the diagnosis, but we had to move on. The next step was finding proper treatment 
for Jeff. After much consideration we decided on DIR/Floortime Therapy (“Floortime”), supplemented with 
Occupational Therapy (“OT”) to address Jeff’s sensory integration needs. 

Floortime is a play-based treatment, focusing on helping children master the building blocks of relating, 
communicating and thinking. Guided interactions between the child and parent, sibling, grandparent or 
caregiver, move the child through six Floortime developmental stages which are: 

1 Self-Regulation and Shared Attention 

2 Engagement and Relating 

3 Two-way Intentional Communication 

4 Purposeful Complex Problem Solving Communication 

5 Creating Ideas 

6 Logical Reasoning, Thinking Logically 

I was taught Floortime by a professional and spent nights watching instructional videos and reading 
Floortime books. I worked with Jeff each day, including Saturday and Sunday. We did Floortime constantly 
even during meals, riding in the car and during bath time. I was working for my son’s future. The more 
therapy he received, the better his chances of “recovery.” No opportunity was missed. 

Each week, over the course of several years, our program leader would assess Jeff’s development and 
determine when he had mastered a skill and when further interventions were needed. 

Over several years, Floortime was resolving Jeff’s developmental issues, and OT was helping his sensory 
integration issues, but another problem was becoming more extreme. By first grade, Jeff had developed anxiety 
that was so irrational and overwhelming that it impaired his school, social and family life. He was very fearful 
and always thinking about the worst things that could happen. Conversations often would “spin out of control” 
as Jeff worried irrationally about things that might happen to him. During these times, I would attempt to 
distract him only to have the anxiety recur. 

As time went on Jeff was not only verbalizing his anxiety, but manifested other unconscious behaviors such 
as eye and verbal tics, chewing on his shirt, and pulling on his hair. 

Our team of doctors did not have a specific answer for Jeff’s anxiety. We tried numerous treatments including 
psychotherapy, de-sensitization therapy, applied behavioral therapy, occupational body regulating therapy, 
and cognitive behavioral therapy. None had much effect on reducing anxiety. 

22 


944 PSYCHIATRY 

Finally, one of our doctors suggested a study at a nearby university which was funded by the National 
Institute of Mental Health. The program was specifically designed for children on the autism spectrum 
suffering from very high anxiety. It was a treatment protocol based on a collaborative, family-based intervention 
approach using targeted cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. It took into consideration Jeff’s spectrum-
based deficits and taught him how his anxiety could be managed by using a coping plan and actively facing his 
fears. The program lasted nearly a year. But we used it regularly for months after it ended. It made a noticeable 
positive impact on Jeff’s anxiety. 

By his fourth grade year Jeff’s physical size of 5’0” and 80 pounds allowed our child psychiatrist to prescribe 
anxiety medication. This made a noticeable positive impact on his anxiety. 

Today Jeff is in a mainstream fifth grade classroom at a public elementary school. He is able to relate to 
others with real warmth. He has many friends, a great imagination and a mischievous sense of humor. His 
anxiety has decreased to the point that it does not drastically interfere with his life. It continues to lessen each 
month. 

Through it all, my family and I have learned that with the proper therapies and treatments, we can define 
an autistic child’s potential not by assumed limitations, but by their own growth. 

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 
22 
CASE REPORTS 

CASE REPORT 1: MAJOR DEPRESSION 

Mrs. Carr, a 58-year-old widow, was brought to an emergency department by her daughter, who found her 
at home in bed in the middle of the day. For a period of months, Mrs. Carr had become increasingly 
withdrawn and dysphoric, without any precipitating events. She had become progressively less active and 
even required encouragement to eat and perform her daily tasks. Her daughter and son-in-law became 
alarmed but did not know what to do. Mrs. Carr’s medical history was unremarkable, but her psychiatric 
history revealed an episode of postpartum depression following the birth of one of her children. 

On examination, the ER physician noted that Mrs. Carr was withdrawn and negativistic, refusing 
to cooperate with the examination, and even refusing to open her mouth. There were signs of acute 
dehydration and decline in personal hygiene and grooming. 

Further questioning of her daughter revealed that Mrs. Carr had become increasingly paranoid and had 
delusions of sinfulness and guilt. Recently, she had shown signs of increasing mutism. 

The physician recognized signs of major depression and arranged for immediate hospitalization. Mrs. 
Carr responded favorably to combined use of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant drug. An alternative 
treatment would have been a course of electroconvulsive therapy, which also produces favorable results. 

CASE REPORT 2: SOMATOFORM DISORDER 

A 35-year-old man presented with a 6-year history of abdominal pain that he was convinced was cancer. 
For most of his life, the patient had been dominated by a tyrannical father who never gave him the love he 
craved. When the patient was 29, his father died of carcinoma of the colon, and soon afterward, the patient 
developed abdominal pain. His complaints gradually increased as his identification with his father, as well 
as his unconscious hostility toward him, increased. The patient came to the clinic almost daily with 
complaints of bloody stools (the feces were found to be free of blood) and the belief that he had cancer. He 
felt that none of the clinic doctors listened to him, just as his father had not. 

Treatment included development of a long-standing, trusting, positive relationship with one of the 
clinic physicians, who allowed the patient time to talk about the illness. His hypochondriasis gradually 
subsided during a 12-month period of a supportive physician-patient relationship. 



PSYCHIATRY 945 


CASE REPORT 3: BIPOLAR DISORDER 

A 30-year-old woman first presented with depression at age 26. Her depression was characterized by 
sadness lasting most of the day, crying spells, severe irritability, hypersomnia with some periods of 
insomnia, anergia (low energy), severe inappropriate guilt feelings, and absence of libido (sex drive). The 
patient described periods of high energy when her “mind ran away,” and her mood was irritable with a 
decreased need for sleep. Initially, she stated that these times would last 1 or 2 days at the most. Her family 
would avoid confrontations with her during those periods of energy and activity. The patient was initially 
diagnosed as suffering from dysthymic disorder with major depression. A bipolar illness was suspected 
based on her 1- or 2-day bursts of energy and activity. History from family members confirmed that she 
had experienced expanded mood states lasting up to a week that met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for hypomanic 
episodes. Her diagnosis was changed to bipolar II disorder. She was placed on a regimen of bupropion 
(Wellbutrin), and the dose was increased to 300 mg/day. Her mood improved in a general way with less 
irritability, more energy, and less sadness. She continued to have rather pronounced premenstrual 
worsening of her mood, however, that did not respond to an increase in the dose of bupropion. In the 
meantime, her physician added lithium to her medical regimen of fluoxetine (Prozac) with robust 
and stable augmentation. Lithium improved the quality of the patient’s response to the bupropion by 
eliminating the premenstrual worsening of mood and fully normalizing her sleep pattern. Lithium was 
then replaced with valproate (Depakote) and the dose titrated to 1000 mg/day. Her robust, stable 
antidepressant response returned without side effects beyond mild weight gain, for which regular exercise 
was prescribed. 

CASE REPORT 4: SCHIZOPHRENIA 

Mike is a 33-year-old divorced man with two children ages 8 and 10, he rarely ever sees. He has never been 
evaluated by a psychiatrist. His family physician has tried to get him to see a local psychiatrist, but Mike 
refuses to go. Mike says he knows someone has removed his brain and replaced it with someone else’s. He 
believes that this brain is controlling him and that he is not responsible for his actions. He works every 
day and has been on his current job for 15 years. He says he has lots of friends but sometimes he thinks 
it’s one of them who did this to him. He reports incidents in which he has been injected with something 
while shopping and speaks of a government conspiracy to kill him. He has a college education and has a 
degree in computer science. His family physician ordered an MRI study, which showed negative findings, 
and he also had an EEG. The EEG results came back normal.
